    title: "Rising Up: Labor, Abolition, and Reform in the Industrial Era",
    intro: "Industrialization created the conditions for some of the most powerful social movements in modern history. Workers who had no individual bargaining power discovered collective power — and paid for it with arrests, beatings, and deaths. Abolitionists who challenged slavery's deep structural connection to industrial capitalism eventually prevailed — in Britain in 1833, in the United States in 1865 — after decades of organizing and, in the American case, a catastrophic civil war. Reformers who confronted the sanitation disaster of industrial cities saved millions of lives by building sewers. Understanding Topic 5.8 means understanding that the industrial age was not simply imposed on people — it was contested, reformed, and resisted, with real consequences.",

        bullets: [
          "**The legal framework workers faced**: In Britain, the **Combination Acts** (1799, 1800) made it illegal for workers to combine to demand higher wages or better conditions — trade unions were criminal conspiracies. In the United States, courts used the common law doctrine of criminal conspiracy to prosecute union organizers through most of the 19th century. The legal framework treated employment as a free contract between individuals: any collective action to change that contract was coercion. This was not neutral law — it treated the grossly unequal power relationship between a factory owner and an individual worker as if they were equals negotiating freely, while making collective equalization of that power illegal.",
          "**Britain's path**: The Combination Acts were repealed in 1824, legalizing union organizing, though courts continued to restrict strike action. **Craft unions** — organizing skilled workers by trade — grew through the 1850s–1870s. The **Trades Union Congress** (TUC, 1868) created a national federation. By the 1880s–1890s, 'new unionism' organized less-skilled workers in docks, gas works, and general labor. The **Dockers' Strike of 1889** — won after enormous public sympathy and a five-week stoppage — demonstrated unskilled workers' collective power. The **British Labour Party** (1900) grew from TUC support for parliamentary candidates; by 1906, it had 29 MPs. Britain's path to labor political power ran through the trade union movement and eventually produced a Labour government in 1924.",
          "**The Great Railroad Strike (1877)** was the first major labor uprising in the United States. Railroad workers walked off the job across multiple states in response to a 10% wage cut — the second cut in a year — by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. The strike spread to the Pennsylvania, Erie, and New York Central railroads within days, paralyzing rail traffic in a dozen states. State militias were called in; in Pittsburgh, militia fired on crowds, killing more than 20 people. President Hayes deployed federal troops — the first significant use of federal military force against domestic labor action. The strike was broken after two weeks. Its significance: it demonstrated workers' ability to shut down the industrial economy, and it demonstrated the government's willingness to use military force to protect railroad company property.",
          "**The Haymarket affair (1886)** began as a rally in Chicago's Haymarket Square in support of an eight-hour workday, called the day after police killed two workers at a strike at the McCormick Reaper Works. As police advanced on the crowd, someone threw a bomb; seven police officers were killed, along with four workers. Eight anarchist labor organizers — only one of whom was even present at the rally — were tried for murder in a proceeding widely condemned as unjust; four were hanged. **Haymarket** became a defining moment: for labor radicals, the four executed men were martyrs; for employers and governments, the affair confirmed that union organizing led to violence and must be suppressed. **International Workers' Day (May Day)** was established in 1889 by the Second International to commemorate the Haymarket events — it became a global labor holiday observed everywhere except the United States and Canada.",
          "**The Pullman Strike (1894)**: After the Pullman Palace Car Company cut wages during the depression of 1893 without reducing rents in its company-owned town, workers went on strike. Eugene Debs's American Railway Union organized a nationwide boycott: members refused to handle any train with Pullman cars. Railroad traffic across the Midwest stopped. President Cleveland, over the objection of the Illinois governor, sent federal troops; a federal judge issued an injunction against the boycott. Debs was imprisoned for contempt of court. After his release, he read widely in socialist literature and concluded that reform within capitalism was insufficient — he became the Socialist Party of America's presidential candidate in 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920. The Pullman Strike demonstrated that 'pure and simple unionism' within capitalism was vulnerable to federal power — a lesson that pushed some labor activists toward political radicalism."

          "**The structural connection between industrial capitalism and slavery**: The textile mills of Lancashire and the cotton mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, ran on American cotton. In 1850, cotton was the United States' largest export, providing two-thirds of American export earnings. This cotton was grown by enslaved people on Southern plantations. The Industrial Revolution in Britain and the expansion of American slavery were not separate phenomena — they were parts of the same economic system. British industrialists who bought American cotton knew it was produced by enslaved labor; the question abolitionists forced was whether that knowledge created moral responsibility.",
          "**The Baptist War (1831–32)** — also called the Sam Sharpe Rebellion — was the largest slave revolt in British Caribbean history: approximately 60,000 enslaved people in Jamaica, led by a Baptist deacon named Sam Sharpe, organized a general strike that escalated into armed resistance. British forces suppressed it; 14 white colonists and approximately 500 enslaved people were killed, with hundreds more executed afterward. The rebellion's significance for British abolition: it demonstrated that the slave system was inherently unstable and that enslaved people were actively resisting their condition. Combined with the abolitionist movement's political organizing — 1.3 million petition signatures presented to Parliament in 1833 — the Baptist War helped produce the **Slavery Abolition Act of 1833**, which abolished slavery throughout most of the British Empire (effective 1838). Crucially, the Act included **£20 million in compensation to slaveholders** — not to formerly enslaved people.",
          "**Frederick Douglass** — born into slavery in Maryland, escaped in 1838, became the most powerful public voice of the American abolitionist movement. His autobiography (Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, 1845) was one of the most widely read books of the 19th century. Douglass was a brilliant rhetorician: his famous speech 'What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?' (1852) systematically dismantled the contradiction between American revolutionary ideals and American slavery. Douglass worked with William Lloyd Garrison (publisher of The Liberator), Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman. When the Civil War began, Douglass immediately understood its potential as an emancipation war and lobbied Lincoln to make abolition its explicit goal — which Lincoln eventually did with the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) and the Thirteenth Amendment (1865).",
          "**The Cotton Famine (1861–1865)**: The Union naval blockade of Confederate ports during the Civil War cut off American cotton to British mills. The **Lancashire Cotton Famine** — as British workers experienced it — put approximately 500,000 textile workers out of work, with millions more affected. In a remarkable political moment, Lancashire workers held public meetings declaring their support for the Union cause and opposing Confederate recognition — even at the cost of their own employment. Their calculation: recognizing the Confederacy would mean prolonging slavery; they would not do it. Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter of thanks to the workers of Manchester in 1863, calling their stand 'an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country.' The Cotton Famine forced British mills to diversify cotton sources — turning to Egypt, India, and eventually other regions — which restructured global cotton supply chains and transformed the agricultural economies of Egypt and India in ways that shaped those countries for decades."

          "**Public education reform**: Industrial capitalism both created the conditions that made child labor common and generated the arguments for eliminating it. Factory commissioners' reports documenting children working from age five — and parliamentary acts limiting and eventually prohibiting child factory labor — created pressure for alternatives. Where would children be if not in factories? Schools. **Britain's Education Act of 1870** (the **Forster Act**) established publicly funded elementary schools wherever church schools were inadequate; subsequent legislation (1880) made attendance compulsory for children aged 5–10; the 1891 act made state elementary schools free. In the United States, Massachusetts was the first state to require school attendance (1852); by 1918, all states had compulsory education laws. The argument for mandatory education combined humanitarian concern (children should learn, not work) with industrial-era economic logic (an industrial economy needed workers who could read safety instructions, do basic arithmetic, and follow written rules) and political logic (democratic governments needed literate citizens).",
          "**Public health reform** emerged from the catastrophic sanitation conditions of industrial cities. Before germ theory, no one understood that cholera, typhoid, and other epidemic diseases spread through contaminated water. Edwin Chadwick's **Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain** (1842) documented the direct empirical connection between poor sanitation and early death, even without understanding the mechanism: working-class districts with no sewers had dramatically shorter life expectancies than middle-class districts with better drainage. The average age of death for laborers in Liverpool was 15; for gentry in nearby rural areas, 35. Chadwick argued that good drainage would save money (by reducing disease-related poverty) even before humanitarian arguments convinced anyone.",
          "**The Great Stink (1858)**: A heat wave in the summer of 1858 caused the Thames — London's primary water source and primary sewer — to produce odors so powerful that Parliament, meeting on the riverbank, was nearly unable to function. Members of Parliament fled meetings with handkerchiefs soaked in chloride of lime pressed to their faces. The direct experience of the smell of London's waste water — by the people with political power to fund a solution — produced immediate legislative action. Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette's sewer system — 1,100 miles of sewers carrying waste away from the Thames — was authorized and funded. When it was completed (1875), cholera deaths in London fell dramatically. Germ theory (Pasteur, Koch, 1860s–1870s) later provided the scientific explanation for what Chadwick and Bazalgette had documented empirically: sanitation prevented disease because bacteria in contaminated water caused it. Public sewer systems and clean water supplies spread through industrial cities across Europe and North America through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, producing the most dramatic sustained decline in urban mortality in human history.",
          "**The temperance movement** was one of the largest mass movements of the industrial era, especially in the United States, where the **Women's Christian Temperance Union** (WCTU, founded 1874) became the largest women's organization in 19th-century America. Temperance advocates argued that alcohol consumption destroyed working-class family life: wages spent on drink rather than food; husbands returning home violent; children neglected. The argument had force in an era when industrial wages were low, working hours long, and alcohol cheap — and when legal protections for women and children in the household were minimal. The WCTU, under Frances Willard's leadership, expanded its mission beyond temperance to women's suffrage, labor reform, and social welfare — making 'Do Everything' its motto. The temperance movement ultimately achieved prohibition in the United States (Eighteenth Amendment, 1919) — a significant policy win that also proved deeply problematic in practice, fueling organized crime and eventually being repealed (Twenty-First Amendment, 1933)."

Eight anarchist labor organizers were tried for murder; none was proven to have thrown the bomb, and only one was even present at the rally. Four were hanged, one committed suicide in prison, and three were eventually pardoned in 1893 by Governor John Peter Altgeld, who called the trial 'packed with men hostile to the defendants.' The Haymarket affair became a defining moment in American labor history. This adapted excerpt includes statements by the defendants at their sentencing.",
    text: [
      "August Spies, editor of a German-language labor newspaper and one of the eight defendants, addressed the court before sentencing: 'If you think that by hanging us you can stamp out the labor movement — the movement from which the downtrodden millions, the millions who toil and live in want and misery, the wage slaves, expect salvation — if this is your opinion, then hang us! Here you will tread upon a spark, but there and there, behind you and in front of you, and everywhere, flames will blaze up. It is a subterranean fire. You cannot put it out.'",
      "Albert Parsons, the only native-born American among the defendants, refused an offer of clemency that would have required him to plead guilty to charges he denied: 'I could not purchase my life at the cost of my honor. I could not affirm my guilt when I am innocent. I ask for no mercy. I ask only for justice.' He was hanged on November 11, 1887.",
      "Governor John Peter Altgeld, pardoning the three survivors in 1893: 'The men were not proven guilty of the murder. The jury was packed — made up of men hostile to organized labor, men who had already formed opinions. The judge conducted himself with such malignity that the supreme court of Illinois was moved to say that it was not a trial by jury in any just sense. The conviction was procured not because these men were guilty of a crime, but because they were labor organizers and because their political views were unpopular.'",
      "The Haymarket affair established May 1 as International Workers' Day, commemorated globally. In the United States and Canada, Labor Day was placed on the first Monday in September — a deliberate choice to avoid the Haymarket association. The eight-hour workday that the Haymarket workers died for became legally required in the United States with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 — fifty-two years after the rally."

    questions: [
      "August Spies predicts that the executions will not stop the labor movement — 'It is a subterranean fire. You cannot put it out.' Evaluate this prediction against the historical record: was he right? What happened to the American labor movement after Haymarket — was it suppressed, did it grow, or did it transform? What does the historical outcome reveal about the relationship between repression and radical social movements?",
      "Governor Altgeld's pardon states that the trial 'was not a trial by jury in any just sense' — that the men were convicted because of their political views, not proven crimes. What does this claim reveal about the American legal system's treatment of labor radicals in the 1880s? How does this evidence relate to the broader question of whether industrial capitalism's legal and political systems were neutral arbiters of justice or instruments of class power?",
      "Albert Parsons refused clemency rather than plead guilty to charges he denied. Compare his decision to the situation of the Chartist women you read about in Topic 5.6 — both faced the question of what individuals owe to a political movement and what a political movement owes to individuals. What does comparing these two cases reveal about the personal costs of labor organizing and political dissent in the industrial era?"

The governor has asked President Hayes for federal troops. The troops are coming.",
    detail: "You know what federal troops mean: the strike will be broken by force. Some men are talking about fighting — throwing switches, blocking tracks, refusing to move even when soldiers point rifles at them. Others are saying the strike is already lost and they should go back before they lose their jobs entirely. You have a wife and three children. You also know that if the strike fails without any concession, the next wage cut will come, and the one after that. You are trying to decide what to do when the troops arrive. You are also trying to write a letter to your brother in Pittsburgh, who works on the Pennsylvania Railroad, telling him what is happening and what you are deciding.",
    prompt: "Write the letter to your brother. Tell him honestly what the situation is: the wages, the strike, the militia, the coming federal troops. Then tell him what you are going to do when the troops arrive — and why. Are you staying on the line? Going back to work? Running? Make a choice and defend it. Include what you understand about what this strike means for workers beyond Martinsburg, and what it reveals about who the government serves when it sends troops against workers."
