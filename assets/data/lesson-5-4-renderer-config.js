      { label: 'Industrial regions by 1900', detail: 'By 1900, industrial production was concentrated in a narrow geographic band: Britain\'s Midlands and North (textiles, steel, coal); Belgium\'s Liège and Charleroi basins; Germany\'s Ruhr valley (steel, chemicals, coal — the most productive industrial region in the world by 1900); northeastern United States (Pennsylvania steel and coal, New England textiles); and Japan\'s emerging industrial centers (Osaka, Tokyo, Nagasaki). Outside this band, industrial production was minimal. The map reveals the strikingly narrow geographic distribution of 19th-century industrialization — and makes the geographic question unavoidable: why there, and not everywhere?' },
      { label: 'Japan as the lone non-Western industrializer', detail: 'Japan\'s position on the map is crucial: it is the ONLY non-Western country in the industrial band. This is not because Japan had unique geographic advantages that India, China, or Egypt lacked. Japan had fewer coal deposits than India, less sophisticated pre-existing textile manufacturing than China, and smaller capital reserves than the Ottoman Empire. What Japan had was political sovereignty — the ability to impose protective tariffs, direct state investment, and borrow Western technology on its own terms. The Meiji Restoration (1868) was not primarily a cultural or intellectual revolution; it was a political response to the threat of colonization, and it used state power to industrialize faster than any previous society.' },
      { label: 'Raw material zones and their colonial relationships', detail: 'The areas outside the industrial band — India, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, most of Latin America — are not randomly distributed. They correspond almost perfectly with the zones of European colonial control or economic domination. India (British colony): raw cotton exporter, machine cloth importer. Egypt (informally dominated): cotton exporter after Muhammad Ali\'s factories were destroyed. West Africa: palm oil, groundnuts, and eventually rubber exporters. Latin America (formally independent but economically dependent): silver, copper, guano, rubber, coffee exporters. The geographic pattern of industrialization and non-industrialization mirrors the geographic pattern of colonial and semi-colonial relationships.' },
      { label: 'The sovereignty pattern: the key to the map', detail: 'The most important pattern on this map is the correlation between political sovereignty and industrialization. Germany (unified under Bismarck, 1871) used sovereign power to impose protective tariffs and direct railroad investment. The United States used the tariff of 1816 and subsequent protectionist legislation to shield domestic industry from British competition. Japan used the Meiji state\'s sovereign power to build factories, send missions abroad, and restructure its economy. India, Egypt, and colonized Latin American territories could not do any of these things — their tariff policy, their trade relationships, and their economic structure were determined by European powers in the interests of European industry. Sovereignty explains industrialization; its absence explains deindustrialization.' }

    title: 'Comparing Paths to Industrialization: Who Industrialized, Who Didn\'t, and Why',
    intro: 'Comparison for Topic 5.4 requires identifying both similarities and differences among the paths to industrialization — and synthesizing what the comparison reveals. The most common AP error is describing each country separately without identifying the specific point of comparison. A strong comparison argument uses the structure: "Both X and Y shared [similarity], but X differed from Y in [specific difference], which reveals [broader pattern]."',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Identify a meaningful similarity across cases', text: 'Similarity: All successful industrializers — Britain, Germany, the United States, Japan — had access to capital, a labor force, and some form of key resources (coal, iron, or the ability to import them). But more importantly, all successful industrializers had political sovereignty that allowed them to use protective tariffs and state investment to build domestic industry. This is the most important similarity: not the specific resources, but the political capacity to direct economic development. Countries that lacked sovereignty — India, Egypt, colonized Latin America — also had capital (India was one of the wealthiest regions in the world), labor, and resources. The absence that mattered was political, not natural.' },
      { label: 'Identify a meaningful difference (state-led vs. market-led)', text: 'Difference: Japan and Germany industrialized primarily through state direction — the Meiji government built factories and sold them to zaibatsu; Prussia built railroads and protected heavy industry with tariffs. Britain and the United States industrialized primarily through private enterprise, with the state playing a supporting role (patent law, property rights, tariffs in the US case). The difference produced different industrial structures: Germany and Japan built large industrial conglomerates (Krupp, Mitsui, Mitsubishi) tightly connected to state power; Britain and the US built more fragmented, competitive industrial sectors. Both succeeded — but by different mechanisms. The comparison reveals that there is no single path to industrialization; what matters is having some mechanism to mobilize capital and protect infant industries from established competitors.' },
      { label: 'Write the synthesis statement', text: 'A strong comparison ends with synthesis: what does the pattern reveal? The pattern of 19th-century industrialization reveals that economic development is not a natural or automatic process — it is a political one. Countries industrialized when and because their governments had the will and the capacity to direct economic change: through tariffs, investment, legal infrastructure, and deliberate technology adoption. Countries did not industrialize when foreign powers prevented those policy tools from being used — either through direct colonial control or through imposed trade treaties. The Meiji slogan "rich country, strong army" was not naive: industrial power and military power were inseparable in the 19th century, and the countries that recognized this early industrialized first.' }
