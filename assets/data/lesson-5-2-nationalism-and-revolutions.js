    title: "The Atlantic Revolutions and the Rise of Nationalism",
    intro: "Between 1776 and 1825, a wave of revolutions swept the Atlantic world — each drawing on the vocabulary of the Enlightenment, each claiming to establish a new political order based on natural rights and popular sovereignty, and each defining those rights very differently depending on who was doing the defining. Understanding the Atlantic Revolutions means understanding both their common Enlightenment foundations and their radically different outcomes.",

        title: "The American and French Revolutions: Enlightenment in Action",
        bullets: [
          "The **American Revolution** (1776–1783) drew directly on Locke's natural rights theory and Montesquieu's separation of powers. The **Declaration of Independence** (1776) invoked Locke almost word for word: 'all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' But structural conditions mattered too: the Seven Years War (1756–1763) had left Britain with enormous debt, leading to new taxes on the colonies ('taxation without representation'). Both Enlightenment ideas AND fiscal crisis caused the Revolution — AP causation requires identifying both.",
          "The American Revolution's limits: it created a functioning republic based on Enlightenment principles, but it preserved slavery (approximately 20% of the colonial population was enslaved), restricted political participation to white male property owners, and dispossessed Indigenous peoples from their land. The Declaration's 'all men' explicitly did not include enslaved Africans or women in the political rights it claimed.",
          "The **French Revolution** (1789–1799) was more radical in its initial promises and more violent in its execution. The **Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen** (1789) declared universal natural rights and popular sovereignty, and abolished feudalism and aristocratic privileges. The radical phase — the **Terror** (1793–1794), led by Robespierre — executed tens of thousands, including Louis XVI, in the name of the general will. In 1794, France became the first European power to abolish slavery in its colonies — partly because Toussaint Louverture had allied with France. Napoleon reversed this in 1802.",
          "Structural causes of the French Revolution: France was nearly bankrupt after supporting the American Revolution. The tax system exempted the aristocracy and the Church — placing the burden entirely on commoners. Food shortages in 1788–1789 pushed ordinary people to desperation. The financial crisis created the conditions; Enlightenment ideas provided the vocabulary for what came next."

        bullets: [
          "The **Haitian Revolution** (1791–1804) was the most radical of the Atlantic Revolutions — the only one that was simultaneously a revolution against colonialism, against slavery, and against racial hierarchy. It was led by enslaved and formerly enslaved people who explicitly claimed the universal rights that French and American revolutionaries had declared for all humanity but refused to extend to them. Saint-Domingue (Haiti) was France's most profitable colony — producing 40% of Europe's sugar and 60% of its coffee, all on the labor of approximately 500,000 enslaved people.",
          "The revolution began in August 1791 partly at the **Bois Caïman** ceremony, where enslaved people made a covenant to fight for freedom. **Toussaint Louverture** — a formerly enslaved man of exceptional military and political genius — emerged as the dominant leader. He built a disciplined army that successively defeated the Spanish (who had invaded), the British (who invaded in 1793 hoping to take the colony), and eventually the French army sent by **Napoleon Bonaparte** in 1802 to reimpose slavery.",
          "The context of hypocrisy was explicit: when the French Revolution declared universal rights in 1789, free people of color in Saint-Domingue immediately demanded legal equality — and were denied. When France briefly abolished slavery in 1794, it was partly because Toussaint had allied with France against Spain. When Napoleon sent 50,000 soldiers to reimpose slavery in 1802, the Haitian revolutionary forces defeated them (partly through yellow fever, which killed tens of thousands of French troops). **Haiti declared independence on January 1, 1804** — the first Black republic in the Western Hemisphere and only the second independent state in the Americas.",
          "The aftermath: Haiti's independence terrified slaveholders across the Atlantic world. France demanded **150 million francs** (later reduced to 90 million) as the price of diplomatic recognition — an enormous debt that Haiti did not finish paying until 1947. This 'independence debt' structurally impoverished Haiti for a century and a half. The United States refused to recognize Haiti until 1862 — during the Civil War — because Southern slaveholders feared the implications. The Haitian Revolution is the clearest test of whether Enlightenment universalism was real: it was real enough to inspire a revolution, but the existing Atlantic world punished Haiti for taking it seriously."

The millions of enslaved Africans brought to Saint-Domingue as replacements were the same people who, in 1791, would claim the universal rights that European and American revolutionaries had proclaimed.",

          "**Latin American independence movements** (1810–1825) completed the Atlantic Revolutionary wave. They were largely led by **creoles** — people of European descent born in the Americas — who resented Spanish-born **peninsulares** monopolizing senior colonial offices, resented Enlightenment-inspired trade restrictions, and were inspired by the American and French examples. **Simón Bolívar** (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia) and **José de San Martín** (Argentina, Chile) led military campaigns across South America, explicitly invoking Enlightenment ideas about natural rights and republican government.",
          "**Miguel Hidalgo** launched Mexico's independence movement in September 1810 with his '**Grito de Dolores**' — a call to revolt that drew on indigenous and mestizo populations and was more socially radical than most other Latin American independence movements. Mexico's independence in 1821 resulted in a conservative constitutional monarchy before a republic was established.",
          "The limits: Latin American independence produced conservative outcomes in most cases. Creole elites replaced peninsulares at the top of the social hierarchy, but the **casta system**, the Catholic Church's power, and the plantation economy all continued. Indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans gained formal legal equality in most new constitutions — but formal equality and social reality diverged sharply. Bolívar himself became increasingly authoritarian, lamenting that 'America is ungovernable.'",
          "**Nationalism** — the ideology that emerged from Atlantic Revolutionary movements — held that people sharing a common culture, language, history, or ethnicity should have their own self-governing state. Initially linked to liberal and democratic ideals ('the right of peoples to self-determination'), nationalism became the most powerful destabilizing force in 19th-century politics. The **Ottoman Empire** faced Greek independence (1821–1829), Serbian autonomy, and Bulgarian nationalism. The **Habsburg Empire** faced Hungarian, Czech, Italian, and German nationalist movements. The **Russian Empire** faced Polish nationalist uprisings. For the AP exam, nationalism matters primarily as a **cause** of the instability and eventual collapse of multiethnic empires in the 19th and early 20th centuries."

He became the dominant military and political leader of the Haitian Revolution, defeating Spanish, British, and eventually French armies before being captured through treachery in 1802. He died in a French prison in 1803, months before Haiti's independence. This adapted passage is drawn from his speeches and correspondence to his army during the revolutionary period. Toussaint was extraordinarily literate for a formerly enslaved person — he had unusual access to books and learning as a coachman before the revolution — and his writing demonstrates a sophisticated engagement with Enlightenment ideas.",
