    text: 'In the 1960s, the Aral Sea was the fourth-largest lake in the world, straddling the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Fishing communities lined its shores. Its waters supported an ecosystem that had existed for millennia. Then Soviet central planners decided that the region’s future was cotton. They diverted the Amu Darya and Syr Darya — the two rivers that fed the Aral Sea — into a vast network of irrigation canals. The cotton harvests were enormous. And the lake began to shrink. By the 1990s, the Aral Sea had lost more than half its surface area. By 2014, the eastern basin had vanished entirely. The exposed lakebed became a salt flat, and windstorms carried toxic dust — laced with pesticides and fertilizer residue — across the surrounding region. Respiratory disease rates soared. The fishing industry collapsed. An entire way of life disappeared. The planners who diverted the rivers knew the lake would shrink. They calculated that the cotton revenue would be worth more than the water. They were not wrong about the cotton. They were wrong about everything else.',
    prompt: 'The Soviet planners who drained the Aral Sea knew the lake would shrink but calculated that cotton revenue justified the cost. What does this reveal about how societies weigh short-term economic gain against long-term environmental consequences — and who bears the cost when the calculation is wrong?'
