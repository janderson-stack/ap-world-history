    title: "Primary Source: President Truman's Address to Congress (March 12, 1947)",
    intro: "On March 12, 1947, President Harry Truman addressed a joint session of Congress to request $400 million in aid for Greece and Turkey — both facing communist insurgencies. His speech went beyond the immediate request. Truman framed the Cold War in explicitly ideological terms: two 'ways of life' in competition, one free and one totalitarian. The speech became the foundation of the Truman Doctrine — the U.S. policy of 'containing' communist expansion by supporting governments threatened by Soviet-backed movements. For nationalist leaders watching from Asia and Africa, Truman's speech raised a pointed question: was the 'free world' he described actually free for everyone?",
    text: "At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression. The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.",
    questions: [
      "How does Truman frame the Cold War? What two 'ways of life' does he describe — and what assumptions does this binary framing make about the rest of the world?",
      "How might a nationalist leader in Indonesia, Ghana, or India interpret this speech — especially the phrase 'support free peoples'? Would they see themselves as included in Truman's definition of 'free'?",
      "How does this source help explain why the Non-Aligned Movement emerged? What about Truman's binary framing might have made non-alignment an attractive alternative for newly independent nations?"
