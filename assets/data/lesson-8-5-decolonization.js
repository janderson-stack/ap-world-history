          "The **Indian National Congress (INC)**, founded in 1885, became the organizational backbone of India's independence movement. Under **Mohandas Gandhi**, the INC built mass nonviolent resistance — the Salt March of 1930, the civil disobedience campaigns of the 1930s, and the Quit India Movement of 1942. The INC sought not just independence but a particular kind of sovereignty: moral legitimacy through nonviolent means, which also cultivated international sympathy and made British repression politically costly at home. **Jawaharlal Nehru**, the INC's other central figure, would become India's first prime minister after the Indian Independence Act of 1947.",
          "**Ho Chi Minh** founded the **Viet Minh** in 1941, combining Vietnamese nationalism with communist ideology and organizing resistance against both French colonial rule and Japanese occupation. On September 2, 1945, he declared Vietnamese independence — pointedly quoting the American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man. France refused to accept the declaration, and the **First Indochina War (1946–1954)** followed. The Viet Minh's decisive victory at **Dien Bien Phu** in 1954 forced French withdrawal and the division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel — a case of armed struggle where the colonial power's refusal to negotiate led to military defeat. (This continues from Topic 8.4's discussion of communist revolution and Vietnamese land redistribution.)",
          "**Kwame Nkrumah** returned to the Gold Coast in 1947 after studying in the United States and Britain, where he had attended the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester alongside W.E.B. Du Bois, Jomo Kenyatta, and others. He split from the more conservative **United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC)** in 1949 to found the **Convention People's Party (CPP)**, with the slogan 'Self-Government Now.' In January 1950, Nkrumah launched the **Positive Action** campaign — nonviolent strikes and boycotts — was arrested and imprisoned by British colonial authorities, and then released from prison to serve as Prime Minister after the CPP won the 1951 Gold Coast legislative elections. In 1957, **Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African nation to achieve independence** from colonial rule.",
          "**Gamal Abdel Nasser** led the military coup that overthrew King Farouk in 1952 and became President of Egypt in 1954. Egypt had been nominally independent since 1922 but remained under British military and economic influence. Nasser's signature act — the **nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956** — directly challenged British and French economic interests and imperial prestige. Britain and France responded with military force (the **Suez Crisis, 1956**), but the United States and Soviet Union both opposed the invasion, forcing a humiliating British and French withdrawal. The Suez Crisis demonstrated the limits of European imperial power in the postwar world — and made Nasser the symbol of pan-Arab nationalism and decolonization."

          "After World War II, two distinct paths to independence emerged. The CED captures the comparison precisely: 'some colonies negotiated their independence, while others achieved independence through armed struggle.' AP LO F asks you to compare these processes — not just list the cases, but explain what drove each colony down one road or the other.",
          "**Negotiated independence** was the path taken where the colonial power calculated that the cost of holding the colony outweighed the benefit. **India** achieved independence through the **Indian Independence Act of 1947** — the result of mass nonviolent resistance, wartime exhaustion of British resources, and a Labour government in London more sympathetic to Indian self-determination than its predecessors. **The Gold Coast** (Ghana) achieved independence in 1957 after Nkrumah's CPP demonstrated — through the 1951 election and through Positive Action — that the British could not govern without the CPP's participation. **French West Africa** negotiated a series of independence agreements in 1960, as France recognized the unsustainability of empire after its defeat in Indochina.",
          "**Independence through armed struggle** was the path taken where the colonial power refused to negotiate — often because significant numbers of European settlers had political and economic stakes in maintaining control, or because the metropole's political culture resisted acknowledgment of colonial people's rights. **Algeria's** war of independence (1954–1962) was fought by the **FLN (Front de Libération Nationale)** against France, which at the time classified Algeria not as a colony but as a department of France itself — making withdrawal a constitutional and political crisis as well as a military one. Over 1 million Algerians died. **Angola** fought Portuguese rule until 1975 (continuing Topic 8.3's Luanda Decision). **Vietnam** — the third armed-struggle case in the CED — was fought first against France (1946–1954) and then against American-backed South Vietnamese forces (1955–1975).",
          "**What conditions pushed a colony one road or the other?** Four factors matter for AP comparison: (1) **Settler presence** — large European settler populations (Algeria, Angola) gave the metropole political reasons to resist withdrawal; (2) **Metropole politics** — Labour Britain was more willing to negotiate exit than the French Fourth Republic facing Algeria; (3) **Leadership strategy** — Gandhi and Nkrumah built nonviolent mass movements that made British repression politically costly; Ho Chi Minh chose armed resistance because France refused to recognize the 1945 independence declaration; (4) **Cold War stakes** — both the U.S. and the USSR pressured former European powers to decolonize, but Cold War framing also meant that movements labeled 'communist' faced different responses from Western powers."

          "Colonial empires drew borders without regard for ethnic, religious, linguistic, or cultural communities. When European powers withdrew, these borders — inherited by newly independent states — became fault lines for some of the most violent conflicts of the postwar world. The CED identifies this pattern in KC-6.2.I.C: 'Regional, religious, and ethnic movements challenged colonial rule and inherited imperial boundaries.' Some of these movements emerged before independence; others broke out after.",
          "The **Muslim League**, founded in 1906, represented Muslim political interests within British India. As the INC under Gandhi and Nehru pushed for a unified independent India, League leader **Muhammad Ali Jinnah** argued that Muslim-majority regions needed a separate state to protect Muslim political and cultural rights in a Hindu-majority country. The result was **Partition in 1947** — the simultaneous creation of India and Pakistan, with one of the largest forced migrations in history: approximately 10–20 million people displaced and an estimated 200,000–2 million killed in intercommunal violence. Partition was not just the end of British rule; it was the violent redrawing of colonial boundaries along a fault line the British had both created and deepened.",
          "The **Québécois separatist movement** in Canada arose from the political and cultural marginalization of French-speaking Québécois within an English-dominated confederation. Though Canada was never formally colonized in the same way as Asian or African territories, the Conquest of 1760 created a persistent linguistic and cultural minority within a state whose dominant language and culture were English. The **Parti Québécois** (founded 1968) pursued independence through democratic means; the **FLQ (Front de libération du Québec)** used political violence during the **October Crisis of 1970**. Quebec held independence referenda in 1980 (rejected 60-40) and 1995 (rejected 50.6-49.4). The movement illustrates that 'inherited imperial boundaries' challenged political legitimacy even within established Western democracies.",
          "The **Biafra secessionist movement** demonstrated the violence possible when post-independence states refused to accept challenges to colonial-era boundaries. **Nigeria** gained independence from Britain in 1960 as a federation of three major ethnic groups: Hausa-Fulani (north), Yoruba (southwest), and Igbo (southeast). The boundaries were British, the federation was artificial, and political and economic competition between groups was intense. After a 1966 military coup, anti-Igbo pogroms drove Igbo people back to the southeast, and the Igbo-majority southeastern region declared independence as the **Republic of Biafra** in 1967. The **Biafran War (1967–1970)** killed an estimated 1–3 million people, many from the famine blockade imposed by the Nigerian government. Nigeria's reunification preserved the colonial-era boundary — but at catastrophic human cost."
