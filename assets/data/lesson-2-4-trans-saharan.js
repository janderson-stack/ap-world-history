          "An improved **North African camel saddle**, developed around the 3rd century BCE and refined over centuries, allowed riders to sit behind the hump and control the animal effectively, making camels practical not just as pack animals but as mounts for desert guides and warriors.",
          "**Caravans** — organized convoys of hundreds or thousands of camels led by experienced guides — pooled resources and reduced individual risk; **oases** spaced across the desert provided the water, food, and shelter that made journeys of up to 1,700 miles commercially viable."

          "The **Wangara goldfields** of the western Sudan produced enormous quantities of gold, while the **Taghaza salt mines** in the central Sahara produced slabs of salt so valuable they were literally used as currency; Mali's rulers grew extraordinarily wealthy by taxing both commodities as they crossed their territory.",
          "**Mansa Musa**, ruler of Mali from approximately 1312 to 1337, embodied the empire's wealth: his 1324 hajj to Mecca — a 4,000-mile journey with a retinue reportedly including 60,000 people and 80 camels carrying gold — distributed so much gold across Egypt and Arabia that it caused **inflation** in Cairo for more than a decade."

    intro: "Ibn Battuta visited the Mali Empire in 1352–1353, crossing the Sahara from North Africa. His account in the Rihla provides one of the most detailed eyewitness descriptions of Mali's wealth, governance, and society. This adapted passage reflects his observations of the Mali court and its connection to the wider Islamic world.",
    text: "I arrived at the town of Mali, the capital of the king of the blacks, and met the sultan Sulayman. He is a miserly king, and great gifts are not to be expected from him. I witnessed on his part a deed of generosity toward the pilgrims and those who came to him. He gave food, bread, and milk and gold to the pilgrims. His court is held in a great open place. He has with him his governors and the commanders of his soldiers, and a crowd of people. His interpreter stands before him, and the jurists, doctors of law, and preachers sit to his right. He receives men seated, and all about him bow down. He is surrounded by more than three hundred armed slaves.",

      "What evidence does Ibn Battuta provide that Mali's rulers had adopted Islamic customs and connected to wider Islamic networks?",

      "Ibn Battuta was a Muslim scholar traveling with high expectations of generosity from Islamic rulers. How might his perspective shape what he notices and how he judges what he sees?"
