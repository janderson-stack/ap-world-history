    text: 'When world coffee prices collapsed after 1929, Brazil — supplier of most of the world\'s coffee — found itself drowning in beans nobody could afford. The Vargas government bought the surplus and destroyed it to prop up prices: tens of millions of bags were burned, dumped at sea, even mixed into road surfacing. And because coffee burns, some Brazilian locomotives were actually fired with coffee beans instead of coal — trains literally running on the crop that had crashed. The destruction of mountains of perfectly good coffee, while people elsewhere stood in bread lines, became one of the Depression\'s strangest images of a broken global market.',

    intro: 'Topic 7.4 is the AP\'s favorite kind of comparison: one common cause (the Depression), multiple responses (New Deal, fascist corporatist economy, Five-Year Plans, Brazil and Mexico). A weak answer describes each response separately; a strong one names a precise similarity, a precise difference, and what the difference reveals about ideology. Build the frame below.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Name the similarity (with evidence)', text: 'All four responses fit KC-6.3.I.B: government took a more active role in economic life. Evidence: the WPA put millions on the federal payroll; Mussolini\'s corporations fused state and industry; the Five-Year Plans put the whole economy under state command; Vargas built state-owned enterprises and Cárdenas nationalized oil. The similarity is real and specific — not just "governments did stuff."' },
      { label: 'Name the difference (with evidence)', text: 'The responses differed in who controlled the economy and what happened to rights. The New Deal expanded intervention inside democracy — courts, elections, and unions survived. The fascist corporatist economy curtailed unions and individual rights in service of nationalist goals. The Soviet plans abolished private control entirely and enforced the system with repression — collectivization, forced labor, and famine. Brazil and Mexico tied state ownership to popular nationalism.' },
      { label: 'Say what the difference reveals', text: 'Finish with the analytical payoff: the same economic crisis was refracted through ideology. Where power was accountable, intervention came with rights attached; where it was not, intervention became an instrument of state power over the population — most catastrophically in the Soviet case, where the Key Concept itself notes "repressive policies, with negative repercussions for the population."' }
