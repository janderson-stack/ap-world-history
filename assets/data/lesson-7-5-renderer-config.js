// RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE: all College Board CED text below is verbatim from the
// AP World History: Modern CED and must not be paraphrased or truncated.
// NOTE: the thematic focus for this topic is GOV (Governance) — it changes back
// from ECN (Topic 7.4). Do not carry the ECN text forward. The illustrative-
// examples block is verbatim CED text attached to KC-6.2.I.B as a flat array
// with TWO headed groups — "Territorial gains:" (two bullets) and "Anti-imperial
// resistance:" (two bullets) — each heading as a lead entry, matching the
// structure used across Unit 4–7 configs.

    text: 'When Japan carved Manchukuo out of Manchuria in 1932, it needed a face for the new state — so it reinstalled Puyi, the last emperor of China, who had been deposed as a child in 1912. He was crowned again, this time as ruler of Manchukuo, in robes and ceremony fit for a sovereign. But the throne was pure theater. Every law was written by Japanese advisers; the Kwantung Army guarded his palace and controlled who entered and left; he could not appoint his own ministers or even leave the grounds without permission. An emperor in name presiding over a conquest run entirely by someone else — sovereignty as stage scenery for empire.',
    prompt: 'Manchukuo had an emperor, a flag, a capital, and a name — everything a state is supposed to have except actual independence. What does this elaborate performance of sovereignty reveal about how imperial states "gained additional territories through conquest" while disguising the gain as something else?'

    intro: 'Topic 7.5 is built for the AP\'s continuity-and-change skill: the Learning Objective asks you to explain the continuities AND changes in territorial holdings. A weak answer lists what happened; a strong one sorts each development into continuity (control maintained) or change (territory gained, borders redrawn, resistance rising) and explains the relationship between them. Build the frame below.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Name the continuity (with evidence)', text: 'The overarching continuity is the Key Concept itself: between the wars, Western and Japanese imperial states PREDOMINANTLY MAINTAINED control over colonial holdings. Evidence: Britain and France kept their pre-war empires intact, and the mandate system handed them MORE rather than freeing anyone — the rhetoric of "preparing territories for self-governance" masking continued colonial control.' },
      { label: 'Name the changes (with evidence)', text: 'Two kinds of change. (1) Territorial GAINS: former German colonies transferred to Britain and France under League of Nations mandates; the post-Ottoman Middle East divided by Sykes-Picot; Japan\'s conquest of Manchuria and creation of Manchukuo and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (2) Rising RESISTANCE: the Indian National Congress (galvanized by the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre) and West African strikes, protests, and congresses against French rule.' },
      { label: 'Say what the relationship reveals', text: 'Finish with the analytical payoff: continuity and change were happening at once. Imperial control was maintained AND expanded (gains) even as it was increasingly challenged (resistance). The tensions this left unresolved — borders drawn without regard to ethnic and sectarian lines, conquered peoples under puppet states, colonized peoples demanding self-determination — became the fuse for the next war in Topic 7.6.' }
