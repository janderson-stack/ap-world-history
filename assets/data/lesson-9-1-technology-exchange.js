But the 'Green Revolution' has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space.

Before standardized shipping containers, loading a single cargo ship could take a week. Longshoremen moved goods piece by piece — barrels, crates, sacks, boxes of different sizes — by hand and hand truck. McLean's insight was brutally simple: make every box the same size. His containers could be loaded by crane in minutes and transferred directly to trucks or trains without unpacking.
