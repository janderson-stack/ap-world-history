    title: "A New Kind of Society: Class, Home, and the Industrial City",
    intro: "Industrialization did not just change what people produced — it remade who they were. In the span of a few generations it created two new social classes, split family and gender roles along class lines, and packed millions of people into cities that were not built to hold them. Topic 5.9 is about that social transformation: how industrialization reshaped social hierarchies and standards of living from the top of society to the bottom.",

          "**The old hierarchy gets scrambled**: For most of history, society was sorted mainly by land and birth — aristocrats who owned estates at the top, peasants and artisans below, with status largely fixed at birth. Industrialization cracked that order open. As factories, railroads, and global trade reorganized how wealth was created, two entirely new social classes rose to define the age (KC-5.1.VI.A).",
          "**The middle class**: This class included factory owners, merchants, bankers, engineers, and a fast-growing body of professionals — lawyers, doctors, managers, and clerks. Their status came from business, skill, and salaries rather than noble titles or inherited land. As industry expanded, the middle class grew in both numbers and political influence, building comfortable homes, funding schools, and pushing for reforms that protected property and rewarded ambition.",
          "**The industrial working class**: This class was made up of the men, women, and children who actually ran the machines. They owned no factories; they sold their labor for wages, often working twelve-hour shifts in hot, loud, and dangerous factories and mines. The widening gap between the owner who collected the profits and the worker who breathed the cotton dust became one of the defining social tensions of the nineteenth century."

          "**Working-class families**: One paycheck was rarely enough to survive on, so wives and children worked too — spinning thread in textile mills, tending machines, or hauling materials in mines. Their wages were essential to the family's survival, and women were routinely paid less than men for the same labor. For these families, industrialization pulled nearly everyone into the wage economy (KC-5.1.VI.B).",
          "**Middle-class families and 'separate spheres'**: Because a single salary could support the entire household, the middle-class wife was increasingly expected not to earn money at all, but to manage the home and raise the children. A powerful belief known as 'separate spheres' took hold: men belonged to the public world of work and politics, women to the private world of the household. The ideal of domesticity steered middle-class women away from education and paid professions.",
          "**The paradox**: The same force — industrialization — pushed working-class women *into* wage labor and middle-class women *out* of it. The difference was economic: working-class families needed every wage; middle-class families could afford a single earner, and turned that into a social expectation about where women belonged."

          "**Why cities exploded**: The need for factory workers drove a massive migration from the countryside to the cities. Urban populations grew faster than anyone could manage, and cities simply were not built to hold the new arrivals (KC-5.1.VI.C).",
          "**The cluster of challenges**: Rapid, unplanned growth produced exactly the problems the CED names — pollution from coal-burning factories; poverty among workers whose wages barely covered rent; rising crime in overcrowded districts; public health crises as diseases like cholera and typhoid spread through neighborhoods with no clean water or sewers; severe housing shortages that forced families into packed tenements; and infrastructure (water, sanitation, transit) that could not keep up with the influx.",
          "**Disease and the road to reform**: Tenement overcrowding plus contaminated water made epidemic disease a defining feature of the industrial city. Over time these conditions sparked sanitation laws, public health measures, and housing regulations — the reform story developed more fully in Topic 5.8. For 5.9, the key takeaway is the whole transformation: industrialization reshaped social hierarchies *and* standards of living, for better and for worse."

      "She described how overseers used physical punishment to keep exhausted children working at the pace of the machines, and how years of standing and repetitive strain at the looms and frames left some workers with permanent physical deformities.",
      "Reformers used such testimony to argue that the factory system, left unregulated, sacrificed the health of women and children to production — while factory owners argued that family wages depended on this labor and that regulation would raise costs.
