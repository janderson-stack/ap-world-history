    text: 'In 1956, a former trucking company owner named Malcom McLean loaded 58 aluminum containers onto a converted oil tanker in Newark, New Jersey. Before standardized shipping containers, loading a single cargo ship could take a week. Longshoremen moved goods piece by piece — barrels, crates, sacks, boxes of different sizes — by hand and hand truck. McLean\'s insight was brutally simple: make every box the same size. His containers could be loaded by crane in minutes and transferred directly to trucks or trains without unpacking. By the 1970s, containerization had cut shipping costs by over 90% and destroyed the old dockworker economy overnight. A technology no one celebrated at the time quietly made globalized manufacturing possible.',
