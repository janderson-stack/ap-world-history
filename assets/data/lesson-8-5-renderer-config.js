The CPP demands "Self-Government Now." Nkrumah is weighing Positive Action — a campaign of nonviolent strikes and boycotts. But colonial officials are branding the CPP as communist-influenced, and the question of how the campaign reads in London and Washington matters as much as what happens in Accra. Choose your role, choose your path, and reason from January 1950 — no hindsight about Ghana 1957 allowed.'
