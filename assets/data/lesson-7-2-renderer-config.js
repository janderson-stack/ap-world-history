Earlier on 28 June 1914, a first bomb attack on Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s motorcade failed — the bomb bounced off his car. Hours later, the Archduke’s driver, who had not been told the route had changed, took a wrong turn and stopped to reverse — directly in front of Gavrilo Princip, who had given up and was standing outside a Sarajevo delicatessen. Princip stepped forward and fired twice. A missed route briefing put the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne five feet from the one man in the city still ready to kill him.',
