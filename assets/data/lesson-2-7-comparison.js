          'AP comparison questions ask you to **explain a similarity AND a difference** and connect both to a broader historical argument — not just list facts. A strong comparison states a claim ("although all three networks shared X, they differed significantly in Y because Z"), uses specific evidence, and explains the historical significance.',
          'The most powerful comparisons in Unit 2 connect to **causation**: why did the Indian Ocean network carry different religions than the Silk Roads? Because monsoon winds created different merchant communities with different cultural backgrounds. Why did the trans-Saharan routes produce different state structures? Because controlling desert access created different political incentives than controlling maritime ports.',
          'Knowing the differences across networks also prepares you for **continuity and change over time (CCOT)** arguments: after 1450, the Indian Ocean network would be transformed by Portuguese intrusion, the trans-Saharan routes would face competition from Atlantic alternatives, and the Silk Roads would decline — but the patterns of diaspora, exchange, and cultural diffusion established in this era would continue in new forms.'

They exported gold, ivory, and enslaved people in exchange for Indian cotton textiles, Persian ceramics, and Chinese porcelain. Their culture was a blend of Bantu African, Arab, and Persian influences — a direct product of Indian Ocean commercial integration.

Their populations reflected the cosmopolitan character of the routes: merchants, scholars, and pilgrims from China, Persia, India, and the Mediterranean all passed through. The destruction of many oasis cities during the Mongol conquests of the 13th century, followed by the relative stability of the Pax Mongolica, demonstrates how political conditions shaped trade volumes on overland routes in ways that monsoon-driven maritime trade was less vulnerable to.'

    intro: 'The following is a paraphrased synthesis based on the work of historians Janet Abu-Lughod, K.N. Chaudhuri, and Nehemia Levtzion, who studied Afro-Eurasian trade networks in the c. 1200–1450 period. It represents the scholarly consensus about the similarities and differences across the three major systems.',
    text: 'Historians who study the period from c. 1200 to c. 1450 have identified three major Afro-Eurasian trade networks that together formed what Janet Abu-Lughod called "a world system before European hegemony." The Silk Roads, the Indian Ocean network, and the trans-Saharan routes shared several core features: all moved luxury goods across vast distances; all generated wealthy intermediary states that taxed the traffic; all served as corridors for the spread of Islam and other religious traditions; and all depended on specialized merchant diaspora communities who maintained commercial relationships across cultural and political boundaries. Yet the networks differed significantly. The Indian Ocean system was distinguished by its use of monsoon winds, which made maritime trade more reliable and less expensive than overland alternatives. The trans-Saharan routes depended on camel technology and oasis infrastructure that had no maritime equivalent. The Silk Roads combined overland caravans with river and sea connections through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. The goods each system specialized in also differed: silk and porcelain characterized the eastern Silk Roads; spices, cotton, and precious stones dominated the Indian Ocean; gold and salt defined the trans-Saharan exchange. These differences were not incidental — they reflected the fundamental geographic and ecological realities of each system\'s environment.',
    questions: [
      'According to the scholarly summary, what are the four core features shared by all three trade networks? For each feature, provide one specific historical example that illustrates it.',
      'The summary argues that the differences between the networks "were not incidental — they reflected the fundamental geographic and ecological realities of each system\'s environment." Choose one difference and explain the geographic or ecological factor that produced it.',
      'How does this secondary source differ from a primary source like Ibn Battuta\'s Rihla as evidence for understanding the three trade networks? What can a scholarly synthesis tell us that an eyewitness account cannot, and vice versa?'
