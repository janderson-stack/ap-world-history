    title: "Building Empires at Sea: Three Models of Maritime Power",
    intro: "Use these cards to explain how European states built maritime empires after c. 1500 — three distinct models for controlling global trade and territory: the Portuguese trading post empire, the Spanish territorial colonial empire, and the Dutch/British/French joint-stock company model. Each model reflected the goals, resources, and geographic situation of the state that adopted it.",

        title: "The Portuguese Trading Post Empire: Estado da India",
        bullets: [
          "The **Estado da India** ('State of India') was Portugal's maritime empire in Asia and Africa — not a territorial empire but a **commercial empire based on fortified ports at strategic locations**. Rather than conquer and govern large populations, the Portuguese aimed to control the narrow passages through which trade flowed: the straits, harbor entrances, and chokepoints of the Indian Ocean world.",
          "**Afonso de Albuquerque**, the architect of the Estado da India, seized **Goa** on India's western coast (1510), **Malacca** at the strait between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea (1511), and the **Strait of Hormuz** at the entrance to the Persian Gulf (1515). Whoever controlled these three points controlled the movement of spices, silk, and precious goods across the entire Indian Ocean system. Portuguese **carracks** — large, heavily armed ships — patrolled the sea lanes and could deny passage to ships that refused to pay tolls or carry a Portuguese-issued **cartaz** (trading license).",
          "The Portuguese model worked because **force multiplication**: a relatively small number of ships and soldiers could control enormous trade volumes if positioned at the right geographic chokepoints. Portugal's population of about 1 million could not have conquered and administered all of Asia — but it could station garrisons at a few dozen key ports and extract tolls from the trade that flowed through them.",
          "The Estado da India **did not displace existing Asian trade networks** — Arab, Indian, Chinese, Malay, and Swahili merchants continued to trade throughout the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese inserted themselves as armed toll-collectors at key points, skimming profit from existing trade rather than replacing it. This made the system commercially viable but also vulnerable: when the Dutch arrived in the early 1600s with more capital and better organizational models, the Portuguese could not match them."

        bullets: [
          "The Spanish model was fundamentally different from the Portuguese: rather than controlling trade routes, Spain **conquered and governed large territories and populations**, extracting wealth through forced labor and tribute. The conquest of the **Aztec Empire** (Hernán Cortés, 1519–1521) and the **Inca Empire** (Francisco Pizarro, 1532–1572) gave Spain control over the two largest and wealthiest civilizations in the Western Hemisphere.",
          "Conquest was made possible by a combination of factors: **military technology** (steel weapons, horses, firearms vs. obsidian weapons and no horses), **indigenous alliances** (Aztec enemies like the Tlaxcalans fought alongside Cortés), and above all **disease** — smallpox and other epidemics killed an estimated 50–90% of the indigenous population, decimating the ability to resist. Spanish military superiority alone could not have overthrown empires of tens of millions; disease did the decisive work.",
          "The **encomienda system** organized colonial labor: the Spanish crown granted individual colonists (*encomenderos*) the right to the labor and tribute of a designated indigenous population, in exchange for providing religious instruction and military service. In practice, the encomienda was a system of forced labor that caused enormous suffering. The Dominican friar **Bartolomé de las Casas** documented its abuses in his *Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies* (1542), sparking the first significant European debate about the ethics of colonialism.",
          "The **viceroyalties of New Spain** (Mexico, 1535) **and Peru** (1542) organized Spanish colonial administration into large territorial units governed by a viceroy appointed by the Spanish crown. Beneath the viceroys, a complex hierarchy of officials, judges, and local administrators (*alcaldes*) extended Spanish authority to the local level. The **Catholic Church** was a central institution of colonial rule — missionaries established a vast network of missions across the Americas, converting indigenous peoples and providing the ideological justification for the entire colonial enterprise."

        bullets: [
          "By c. 1600, the **Dutch, British, and French** had entered the competition for Asian and Atlantic trade — and they introduced a fundamentally new organizational model: the **joint-stock company**. Instead of funding voyages directly from the royal treasury (as Portugal and Spain had done), joint-stock companies sold shares to private investors who shared in both the profits and the risks. This allowed far more capital to be mobilized than any single state could provide.",
          "The **Dutch East India Company** (**VOC**, *Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie*, founded 1602) became the most powerful private company in history. Given a monopoly on Dutch trade east of the Cape of Good Hope, the VOC had its own army, navy, and legal authority to sign treaties, wage war, and govern territories. Its headquarters at **Batavia** (modern Jakarta) controlled the **Spice Islands** (Maluku) — the source of cloves, nutmeg, and mace. The VOC displaced the Portuguese in much of the Indian Ocean within a generation.",
          "The **British East India Company** (EIC, founded 1600) initially focused on trade in textiles, tea, and spices. Over the 17th and 18th centuries, it established trading posts at **Surat, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta** — eventually becoming the governing authority over much of the Indian subcontinent by the mid-18th century. The EIC represented the gradual transformation of commercial company into colonial state.",
          "The joint-stock model had decisive advantages: **private capital** funded expansion without straining royal treasuries; **shared risk** encouraged investment in expensive and dangerous voyages; and **competitive pressure** among shareholders drove efficiency. It also had a distinctive character — trading companies were explicitly profit-motivated in a way that Spanish territorial empire was not, and their commercial logic shaped how they governed. The VOC's treatment of the Banda Islands (1621) — where it massacred the population and enslaved the survivors to control nutmeg production — illustrates how the profit motive could produce extreme violence."

    intro: "Bartolomé de las Casas (1484–1566) was a Spanish Dominican friar and one of the first Europeans to criticize the treatment of indigenous peoples by Spanish colonists. He participated in early Spanish colonial ventures before becoming an advocate for indigenous rights. His Short Account was addressed to Prince Philip of Spain and was intended to shock the royal court into reforming the colonial system. This adapted passage describes the encomienda system in the Caribbean.",
    text: "From the very first day they set foot on the Indies, the Spaniards treated the people there as if they were of no account, occupying their lands and treating them as serfs. The governors and settlers who came to the Indies demanded from the Indian leaders gold and labor — more than the land could produce, more than any human body could endure. When the Indian people did not deliver what was demanded, the Spaniards took their revenge with their hands and with the sword and with fire. They set hunting dogs on them. They burned entire villages. They killed or enslaved all those who remained. Those who fled into the mountains died of starvation and exhaustion. Those who remained were worked to death in the mines and on the farms, with insufficient food, in conditions that no free person would accept voluntarily. The Indian nations of the Islands, who had numbered in the millions, were within fifty years reduced to almost nothing — not because they were weak or incapable, but because they were destroyed.",
    questions: [
      "What does Las Casas's account reveal about how the encomienda system worked in practice? What specific methods of coercion and violence does he describe, and how do these connect to the broader goal of extracting labor and tribute?",
      "Las Casas was a Spanish Dominican friar who had himself participated in early colonial ventures before becoming a critic. How might his position — insider turned critic — shape both what he observed accurately and what he might have misrepresented or left out?",
      "Las Casas argued against indigenous enslavement but at one point proposed importing African enslaved workers as an alternative. How does this complicate his status as an advocate for the oppressed, and what does it reveal about the limits of his critique of the colonial system?"
