First identified in the early 1980s, HIV spread globally through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and needle-sharing.

It is only a matter of a few hours then until death comes... We have been gruesome enough, so gruesome that we gruesome ourselves now... It beats any sight they ever had in France after a battle.",

Soldiers were dying in camps and on troop ships, but governments suppressed the news. Spain, which was neutral in the war and had no military censorship, reported its cases openly. Spanish newspapers covered the outbreak extensively, including King Alfonso XIII's own illness.
