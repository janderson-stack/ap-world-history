// Topic 7.8 — Mass Atrocities After 1900
// RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE: all College Board CED text below is verbatim from the
// AP World History: Modern CED and must not be paraphrased or truncated.
// NOTE: the thematic focus is SIO (Social Interactions and Organization), NOT
// GOV from Topic 7.7. This is the first SIO topic in Unit 7. Do NOT carry the
// GOV text forward from the 7.7 config.
// DESIGN DECISION: Topic 7.8 has NO BeInTheRoom scenario. Students are never
// placed in a decision-making role inside a genocide. Module 09 is replaced by
// a Causes & Consequences Matrix — a structured analysis module. Students
// analyze as historians; they never role-play as participants.
// IMAGE POLICY: No images anywhere in this lesson — not on cards and not in
// modals. Lecture segment image objects carry empty URLs intentionally.

    text: 'Raphael Lemkin was a Polish-Jewish lawyer who spent years trying to convince the world that what had happened to the Armenians — and later to the Jews — needed its own word. He argued that the world could not outlaw something it could not name. In 1944, he combined the Greek word genos (race, tribe) with the Latin suffix -cide (killing) and introduced the term genocide in his book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Lemkin then spent years lobbying delegates at the newly formed United Nations, sleeping on park benches and surviving on donated meals. In 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide — the first human rights treaty the UN approved. Lemkin had given the act a name, and that name became the legal foundation for international prosecution. He died in 1959 in a New York apartment, largely forgotten, with unpaid rent.',
    prompt: 'Lemkin argued that the world could not outlaw what it could not name. How does the creation of the word “genocide” — and the Convention that followed — illustrate the connection between how societies define an act and how they respond to it? What does Lemkin’s story suggest about the gap between naming a crime and preventing it?'

      { label: 'Name the consequence (with evidence)', text: 'Identify a specific consequence of the atrocity you chose. Consequences include: the cultural trauma carried by survivors and descendants; international legal frameworks (the Genocide Convention, the ICC); political change (post-genocide reconciliation in Rwanda); or the global awareness and human rights advocacy that followed.' },
      { label: 'Explain the causal connection', text: 'Finish by explaining WHY the cause produced the consequence. Strong causal reasoning does not just say “A happened, then B happened” — it explains the mechanism. For example: the Holocaust revealed that existing international law had no framework for prosecuting the systematic destruction of a people, which directly motivated the drafting of the Genocide Convention in 1948.' }
