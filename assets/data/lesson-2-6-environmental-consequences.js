Some regions fared worse: Florence lost perhaps half its population; some rural areas of southern France lost 60–70%.

It swallowed up many of the good things of civilization and wiped them out." Egypt lost an estimated one-third of its population; Damascus and other major Syrian cities were devastated. Ibn Khaldun saw the plague as a civilizational rupture, not merely a medical event.'

Coastal Lebanon, once famous for its cedars, was largely deforested. Italian merchant city-states sourced timber from increasingly distant regions. Deforestation contributed to soil erosion, altered local climates, and increased the vulnerability of agricultural communities to flooding and crop failure.'

    title: 'Primary Source: Giovanni Boccaccio Describes the Black Death in Florence, 1348',
    intro: 'Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375) was an Italian writer who survived the Black Death in Florence and described its effects in the preface to his famous work the Decameron. This adapted passage is one of the most vivid eyewitness accounts of the plague\'s social and demographic impact.',
    text: 'In the year of Our Lord 1348, there came to the noble city of Florence — the fairest of all the cities of Italy — a mortal pestilence. Whether it descended from the heavens or arose from our own actions, I cannot say. It began in the East and moved westward through every land it touched, sparing no city and no class of people. The signs of the disease were strange swellings, the size of an apple or an egg, which appeared under the armpits or in the groin. These were called gavocciolos. From these, the illness spread through the body and within three days the afflicted were dead. The mortality was so great in the city that the living could not bury the dead. Men who had been healthy in the morning were dead before nightfall. Neighbor fled from neighbor. Fathers abandoned their own children. The gravediggers, paid enormous sums, could barely keep pace. In the surrounding countryside, the poor and the peasants died like animals with no physician and no aid. Many villages stood entirely empty. I estimate that more than a hundred thousand souls died in the city of Florence alone from the month of March to the month of July in that terrible year.',
    questions: [
      'What specific details does Boccaccio provide about the physical symptoms of the plague and its speed of death? How do these details help explain why the disease caused such rapid social breakdown?',
      'What social behaviors does Boccaccio describe that suggest the plague challenged community bonds and traditional obligations? What does this reveal about the social consequences of the Black Death?',
      'What are the limitations of Boccaccio\'s account as a source for understanding the Black Death across all of Afro-Eurasia? What would a historian need to compare it against to get a complete picture?'
