In this way the Khan receives news from the most distant places in only a few days. Along the roads between the great cities, travelers find rest houses called caravanserais, where merchants may sleep and feed their animals. The roads are safe under the Khan's protection, and merchants carry great quantities of silk, spices, and gems from one end of the empire to the other.",
