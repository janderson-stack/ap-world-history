You have converted to Islam, learned Ottoman Turkish, mastered the matchlock musket, and been absorbed into the most elite infantry force in the known world. The smell of gunpowder and forge-smoke fills the camp. Tomorrow, the march begins.',
    intro: 'You are sitting in the Janissary barracks in Edirne, the Ottoman capital before Istanbul, cleaning your matchlock rifle by firelight. Around you, thousands of men are doing the same. The great bombard cannons — each one requiring sixty oxen to move — have already been sent ahead toward Constantinople. You have heard that Sultan Mehmed II has ordered the largest siege artillery ever assembled. You have heard that the Theodosian Walls have held for a thousand years. You have heard that God is on your side.',

You remember the walk to the capital, the language lessons, the prayers, the drilling. You remember learning that loyalty to the sultan was everything, that the corps was your family now. You do not think of yourself as Serbian anymore. You are a Janissary. Tomorrow you will march toward the greatest city in the world and put its walls to the test of Ottoman cannon and Ottoman will.',

      { label: 'Identify the cause', text: 'Gunpowder weapons — specifically large-caliber cannons and matchlock firearms — became available to rulers across Eurasia after c. 1450 through a combination of technological diffusion from China, improvements in iron casting, and state investment in military production.' },
      { label: 'Explain the mechanism', text: 'Cannons made traditional fortifications — stone walls, castles, city defenses — vulnerable for the first time. Rulers with gunpowder artillery could breach walls that had previously been impregnable, enabling conquest of territories that would have been impossible to take with pre-gunpowder armies.' },
      { label: 'Connect to the effect', text: 'Because gunpowder weapons gave states decisive military advantages, rulers who acquired them could expand rapidly at the expense of states that lacked them. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (1453) is the clearest example: the Theodosian Walls had resisted sieges for a thousand years, but fell within weeks to Ottoman bombard artillery.' }
