Britain industrialized first (Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow), followed by continental Europe (the Ruhr, northern France, Belgium) and the United States (the Northeast and Great Lakes). The geography of industry, not population alone, determined where the new urban society took shape.' },

Working-class families lived in dense housing packed close to the factories and mills where they worked. The growing middle class — able to afford it — increasingly moved to cleaner neighborhoods and, later, suburbs at the edges, separated from the smoke and crowding. The same city contained sharply different standards of living within a short walk of each other.' },
      { label: 'Rural-to-urban migration', detail: 'The demand for factory labor pulled a massive migration from the countryside into the cities. This migration is what made urbanization "rapid" — and rapid growth, more than urban life itself, is what overwhelmed cities. Housing, water, and sanitation were built (when they were built at all) for far smaller populations.' },

Reform — sewers, clean water, housing codes — arrived unevenly and usually late, so the gap in life expectancy between rich and poor districts could be stark.' }

    intro: 'Learning Objective J is a causation objective: "Explain how industrialization caused change in existing social hierarchies and standards of living." The most common AP error is listing effects without explaining the mechanism that connects cause to effect. This builder walks the chain from the single cause — industrialization — to its distinct social effects.',

      { label: 'Name the cause and a first-order effect', text: 'Cause: industrialization — the factory system, wage labor, and the concentration of capital. First-order effect: a new class structure. The middle class formed from those whose wealth came from business, skill, and salaries (owners, merchants, professionals); the industrial working class formed from those who sold their labor for wages. The mechanism: factory production rewarded capital and management on one side and created mass wage employment on the other, splitting society along a new economic line rather than the old line of land and birth.' },
      { label: 'Trace a divergent effect by class', text: 'Same cause, different effect depending on class. In working-class families, low wages meant the family needed every earner, so women and children entered wage labor. In middle-class families, a single salary was enough — and that economic fact hardened into the ideology of "separate spheres," confining middle-class women to the household. The mechanism is economic: the family\'s need (or lack of need) for additional income drove women in opposite directions across the class line.' },
      { label: 'Write the synthesis', text: 'Synthesis: industrialization caused change in BOTH social hierarchies (a new middle class and working class) AND standards of living (improved for some, degraded for others) — and it did so through identifiable mechanisms. Rapid urbanization, itself caused by the migration of workers to factory cities, then produced the cluster of urban challenges (pollution, poverty, crime, public health crises, housing shortages, weak infrastructure) because city growth outpaced the capacity to plan, house, and sanitize. A strong causation answer names the mechanism at each link, not just the outcome.' }
