    title: "Labor, Administration, and Silver: Maintaining Maritime Empires",
    intro: "European maritime empires after c. 1500 were sustained by three interlocking systems: forced labor that extracted resources from colonies, bureaucratic administration that maintained imperial order, and global trade networks that channeled wealth back to Europe. Understanding how these systems worked together — and how each depended on the others — is essential for Topic 4.5.",

        bullets: [
          "The **encomienda system** organized the basic relationship between Spanish colonists and indigenous peoples: the crown granted a colonist (*encomendero*) the right to extract labor and tribute from a designated indigenous community, supposedly in exchange for Christian instruction and military protection. In practice, it concentrated enormous power in individual colonists and created conditions of extreme exploitation that Bartolomé de las Casas documented in his *Short Account* (1542).",
          "As disease killed 50–90% of the indigenous population in the century after contact, the encomienda became inadequate — there were not enough workers. The **mita system** filled the gap at Potosí: adapted from the Inca *mit'a*, it required indigenous communities to supply rotating labor drafts to the silver mines. Workers traveled weeks to reach Potosí, descended into lethal conditions underground, and were exposed to mercury poisoning used in silver processing. Death rates were catastrophic.",
          "**Chattel slavery** developed as the plantation economy demanded a labor force in coastal zones where the mita did not reach. The Portuguese introduced enslaved Africans to Brazil's sugar plantations in the 1530s; the Spanish, Dutch, British, and French followed in the Caribbean and Atlantic coast. Chattel slavery was hereditary, racially defined, and gave enslaved people no legal recourse — qualitatively more absolute than the mita or encomienda.",
          "The three systems coexisted and complemented each other geographically: the mita dominated the highland mining zones of the Andes; the encomienda persisted in agricultural regions; chattel slavery dominated coastal plantations. Each was matched to the economic function of the region it served."

        bullets: [
          "The Spanish colonial empire governed enormous territories across two continents from a capital thousands of miles away. The **viceregal system** placed royal governors — viceroys — at the head of each major territorial unit: the **Viceroyalty of New Spain** (capital: Mexico City, established 1535) and the **Viceroyalty of Peru** (capital: Lima, established 1542). Viceroys were appointed by the crown, served limited terms, and were subject to review (*residencia*) at the end of their tenure.",
          "**Audiencias** — royal courts with combined judicial, legislative, and administrative functions — provided day-to-day governance across the colonies. There were eventually twelve audiencias across Spanish America, each serving as the primary mechanism of colonial law and order. Indigenous peoples could bring complaints to the audiencias, though access was limited and outcomes often unfavorable.",
          "The **Catholic Church** was the most pervasive institution of colonial rule. **Franciscan, Dominican, and Jesuit missionaries** established missions across the Americas, converting indigenous peoples, running schools and hospitals, and serving as the only European presence in many frontier regions. The Church justified colonial rule theologically — conquest and colonization were framed as a Christian duty to bring salvation to indigenous peoples. Missionaries like Las Casas challenged the brutality of this project from within, but the Church as an institution remained deeply embedded in colonial power.",
          "The **Casa de Contratación** in Seville controlled all trade between Spain and its colonies, functioning as the commercial backbone of the empire. It registered ships, trained pilots, administered the trading monopoly, and regulated the flow of silver from the Americas to Spain. This commercial monopoly channeled wealth through Seville and gave the Spanish crown direct revenue from colonial trade."

        title: "Silver and the Global Economy: Potosí to Manila to Seville",
        bullets: [
          "**Potosí** (modern Bolivia) was the engine of the Spanish colonial economy and the most important single source of silver in the world from c. 1550 to c. 1700. By 1600 it was the largest city in the Western Hemisphere — roughly 160,000 people — sustained entirely by silver extraction. The **mita system** conscripted indigenous workers from a radius of hundreds of miles. Mercury, imported from Huancavelica, was used to amalgamate silver from ore — a process that caused severe neurological damage in workers exposed to mercury fumes.",
          "The **Manila Galleon trade** (1565–1815) was the first regularly scheduled transoceanic trade route. Silver mined at Potosí was transported to Mexico City and then to Acapulco, where it was loaded onto galleons for the trans-Pacific crossing to Manila. In Manila, silver was exchanged for Chinese silk, porcelain, lacquerware, and spices — then carried back to Acapulco and overland to Veracruz for the Atlantic crossing to Seville. This circuit was driven by **Chinese demand for silver** to pay taxes under the Single Whip Tax Reform (1581), which required payment in silver rather than grain or labor.",
          "The **global price revolution** was the economic consequence of this silver flood. The enormous increase in the silver supply caused inflation across Europe and Asia — prices roughly tripled in Western Europe between 1500 and 1650. This disrupted established economic relationships, accelerated the decline of feudal arrangements, and benefited merchants and debtors while harming creditors and those on fixed incomes. Spain itself was paradoxically weakened: the silver influx allowed Spanish monarchs to fund wars without fiscal discipline, and inflation eroded the competitiveness of Spanish industry.",
          "The Manila Galleon trade illustrates a key theme for AP World History: **existing trade networks adapted to incorporate new commodities and routes rather than being replaced by them**. Chinese merchants, Portuguese intermediaries, and indigenous traders all participated in the silver economy. The Indian Ocean trade continued; Arab and Chinese merchants continued to dominate their sectors; the new global network built on and through the old."

The mita was justified as an adaptation of the Inca mit'a — a continuity argument that masked the much more brutal conditions of colonial silver mining.

    title: "Primary Source: Viceroy Toledo on the Mita at Potosí, c. 1575",
    intro: "Francisco de Toledo served as Viceroy of Peru from 1569 to 1581 and is credited with formalizing the mita system at Potosí. His administrative reports to the Spanish crown justified the mita as both legally legitimate (adapting an existing Inca institution) and economically necessary (the silver mines required a guaranteed labor supply). This adapted passage is drawn from his correspondence with Philip II of Spain.",
    text: "The Indians of this land are unaccustomed to the discipline of continuous labor, and without the mita there would be no workers at the mines, and without workers there would be no silver, and without silver there would be no fleet, and without the fleet Your Majesty could not defend his kingdoms. I have therefore organized the mita in the manner of the ancient Inca obligation, requiring each community to send one in seven of its adult men to Potosí for a period of one year, after which they may return and another draft will be sent. The men are paid for their labor — a wage fixed by royal decree — and are fed during their service. The mita is not slavery, which I would not permit; it is an obligation of tribute that every vassal owes to his sovereign, adapted to the conditions of this land. The alternative — to rely on voluntary labor — has been tried and has failed. Without compulsion, the silver of Cerro Rico will remain in the ground, and the empire will be impoverished.",

      "How does Viceroy Toledo justify the mita? What arguments does he use to distinguish it from slavery, and what economic logic does he invoke?",
      "What does Toledo's reference to the 'ancient Inca obligation' reveal about how Spanish colonial administrators used pre-colonial institutions to legitimize new systems of coercion?",

If you fall short, Diego docks your wages. You need those wages: the tribute your village owes the Spanish crown each year must be paid in silver, and the only way to earn silver is to mine it.
