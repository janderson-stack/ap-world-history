    title: "Primary Source: Ibn Battuta on the Port Cities of the Indian Ocean",
    intro: "Ibn Battuta, the Moroccan scholar and traveler, visited Indian Ocean port cities during his journeys of 1325–1354. His account, the Rihla, is one of the most detailed descriptions of Indian Ocean commercial society in this period. This adapted passage reflects his observations of Kilwa on the East African coast.",
    text: "We arrived at Kilwa, one of the most beautiful and well-constructed towns in the world. The whole of it is elegantly built. The roofs are built with mangrove poles. There is very much rain there. The people are engaged in a holy war, for their country lies next to the pagan Zanj. The sultan at this time was Abu al-Mawahib al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman, who was noted for his gifts and generosity. He used to give the clothes off his back as gifts. The country of Kilwa is one of the finest and most fertile in the world. Bananas and coconuts are abundant, and the people eat qadid meat — dried meat and millet — mixed with butter. It is reached by sea from Aden in twenty-three days.",
    questions: [
      "What evidence in Ibn Battuta's description suggests that Kilwa was a cosmopolitan city connected to wider Indian Ocean networks?",
      "How does the reference to travel time from Aden help explain the structure of Indian Ocean trade routes and the role of port cities?",
      "What does Ibn Battuta's emphasis on the sultan's generosity and piety reveal about the relationship between Islam and political authority in Indian Ocean port cities?"
