// Topic 7.7 — Conducting World War II
// RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE: all College Board CED text below is verbatim from the
// AP World History: Modern CED and must not be paraphrased or truncated.
// NOTE: the thematic focus is GOV (Governance), unchanged from Topic 7.6. This
// differs from Topic 7.3 (TEC) — do NOT copy 7.3's thematic focus even though
// the topics are parallel. KC-6.2.IV.A.ii closely parallels the WWI mobilization
// KC in the 7.3 config but is NOT identical: it says "colonies or former
// colonies" and includes the full second sentence on ideologies and
// totalitarian repression. It is copied fresh from the 7.7 CED block, not the
// 7.3 config. The two-heading illustrative-examples block (Western democracies /
// Totalitarian states) is attached to KC-6.2.IV.A.ii as a flat array, matching
// the Topic 7.5 structure. The quotation marks around "total war" in
// KC-6.1.III.C.ii are verbatim CED.
// FIRE-BOMBING HYPHEN FLAG: "fire-bombing" sits on a PDF line break in the
// source CED; the hyphen here should be spot-checked against the CED PDF by the
// owner (see session report).

The U.S. 23rd Headquarters Special Troops — nicknamed the "Ghost Army" — was a secret outfit of artists, designers, sound engineers, and actors whose job was to deceive the enemy with illusion. Their arsenal included inflatable rubber tanks, trucks, jeeps, and aircraft that could be set up overnight to fake an entire armored division; giant speakers that broadcast prerecorded sound effects of marching troops and rumbling tank columns, audible for miles; and phony radio traffic impersonating real units. Many of its soldiers went on to famous careers in fashion, painting, and design. They staged more than twenty battlefield "performances," conjuring whole armies out of rubber and noise to draw German attention away from where the real forces actually were.',

      { label: 'Say what the difference reveals', text: 'Finish with the analytical payoff: same methods, different limits. The democracies show that total mobilization did not require totalitarian control — persuasion and consent could move a whole society. The dictatorships show what happens when mobilization is fused with ideology and unchecked power: the state dominates every aspect of life. That contrast is the bridge to Topic 7.8, where total power over populations reaches its atrocity-producing extreme.' }
