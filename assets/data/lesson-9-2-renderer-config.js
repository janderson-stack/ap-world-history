    text: 'In the spring of 1918, a new strain of influenza began spreading across the world. It would eventually kill more people than World War I itself. But the countries fighting the war — Britain, France, Germany, the United States — censored reports of the illness to maintain wartime morale. Soldiers were dying in camps and on troop ships, but governments suppressed the news. Spain, which was neutral in the war and had no military censorship, reported its cases openly. Spanish newspapers covered the outbreak extensively, including King Alfonso XIII’s own illness. So the world called it the “Spanish Flu” — not because it started in Spain, but because Spain was the only major European country honest enough to talk about it. The name stuck. A century later, we still call it the Spanish Flu, even though its most likely origins were in the United States or Europe. The name itself is a wartime artifact — a reminder that what we call a disease often says more about politics than about biology.',
