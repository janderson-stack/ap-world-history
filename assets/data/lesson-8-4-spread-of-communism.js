        bullets: [
          "The fall of the Qing dynasty (1912) left China without a stable government and began decades of internal crisis. Warlords divided the country; the **Kuomintang (KMT)** under Sun Yat-sen and later Chiang Kai-shek struggled to unify it. The **Chinese Communist Party (CCP)** was founded in 1921, beginning a decades-long struggle between two competing visions for China's future.",
          "**Japanese aggression** — the invasion of Manchuria (1931), the Marco Polo Bridge Incident (1937), and the full-scale Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) — created the conditions that made communist revolution possible. The KMT government bore primary responsibility for fighting Japan and suffered catastrophic losses. The CCP, operating from the countryside and Yan'an, built popular support through land redistribution promises and resistance organizing.",
          "The **Long March (1934–1935)** — the CCP's 6,000-mile retreat from KMT encirclement — became the founding myth of Chinese communism. **Mao Zedong** consolidated leadership during the Long March and emerged as the dominant figure within the party.",
          "After Japan's defeat in 1945, civil war resumed immediately. The KMT, weakened by years of fighting Japan and corrupt governance, lost ground rapidly. In **1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China** from Tiananmen Square. The KMT retreated to Taiwan. China — the world's most populous country — had become communist.",
          "The causes of the communist seizure of power were structural: **internal tension** (political fragmentation, warlordism, failed KMT governance, peasant land hunger) combined with **Japanese aggression** (which devastated the government while the CCP built rural networks) to produce the conditions for revolution. The CED captures this causation exactly: 'As a result of internal tension and Japanese aggression, Chinese communists seized power.'"

        bullets: [
          "The **Great Leap Forward (1958–1962)** was Mao's attempt to rapidly transform China from an agrarian economy into a socialist industrial powerhouse — within a single generation. It represents the CED's key concept directly: communist government control of the national economy, with repressive policies and negative repercussions for the population.",
          "**Agricultural collectivization** reorganized Chinese villages into massive **people's communes** — collective units that replaced family farming with state-directed agricultural production. Communes were expected to meet centrally-set grain quotas and simultaneously produce industrial goods.",
          "The signature policy was the **backyard steel furnace campaign**: every commune was to produce steel, with families melting down metal implements — including farm tools, cooking pots, and door hinges — to meet production targets. The resulting steel was generally unusable brittle pig iron. Meanwhile, the loss of agricultural tools contributed directly to the crop failures that followed.",
          "**Production reporting became catastrophically distorted**. Local and provincial officials competed to report record harvests — often falsifying figures by factors of two, three, or more — to demonstrate ideological commitment and avoid being labeled rightists after the **Lushan Conference (1959)**, when Defense Minister **Peng Dehuai** was purged for criticizing the Leap. Officials who reported honest figures faced the same fate.",
          "Inflated reporting drove inflated **grain procurement quotas**: the state extracted grain based on reported harvests, not actual ones. Villages that had surrendered their real surplus — and their seed grain — starved. The resulting **Great Chinese Famine (1959–1961)** killed an estimated 15–55 million people in what remains the deadliest famine in recorded history. The Great Leap Forward is the CED's 'negative repercussions for the population' operating at catastrophic scale."

          "**Communist Revolution for Vietnamese independence**: Ho Chi Minh's **Viet Minh** combined anti-colonial nationalism with communist ideology — fighting French colonialism while promising land redistribution to Vietnamese peasants. The **First Indochina War (1946–1954)** ended with the defeat of France at Dien Bien Phu and the division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel. Land redistribution was central to the revolution's appeal: the Viet Minh mobilized rural support by promising to break up landlord-held estates.",
          "**Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia**: the **Derg** — a Marxist military junta — overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and nationalized land and industry under Mengistu. Land redistribution broke up large estates, abolished the traditional tenancy system, and eliminated the power of the landed aristocracy. The government's collectivization drive and its brutal suppression of opponents (the **Red Terror**, 1977–1978) produced civil war and famine that killed hundreds of thousands.",
          "**Land reform in Kerala and other states within India**: the **Communist Party of India** won state elections in Kerala in 1957 — the first democratically elected communist government in the world — and implemented sweeping **land reform legislation** redistributing holdings from large landlords to tenant farmers. Unlike China or Ethiopia, Kerala's redistribution operated through democratic institutions, producing significant improvements in landless laborers' conditions without civil war. Other Indian states pursued similar reforms in the 1950s–1970s.",
          "**White Revolution in Iran**: Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi launched the **White Revolution** in 1963 — a top-down modernization and land redistribution program partly designed to preempt communist rural organizing and demonstrate to the Kennedy administration that Iran was reforming. Land reform broke up large religious and aristocratic landholdings. But the disruption of traditional agricultural structures and the social displacement caused by rapid urbanization contributed to the tensions that produced the **Iranian Revolution of 1979**.",
          "**The range matters**: these four CED examples show that redistribution movements took revolutionary (Vietnam), military-junta (Ethiopia), democratic-electoral (Kerala/India), and monarchical top-down (Iran) forms. The causes varied; so did the effects. What they share is that land and resource redistribution — whether communist, socialist, or nationalist — became one of the defining political struggles of the post-1900 world across Africa, Asia, and Latin America."

    intro: "On June 30, 1949 — three months before proclaiming the People's Republic of China — Mao Zedong published 'On the People's Democratic Dictatorship.' The essay explained why China needed communist government and what that government would do with state power. It was both a statement of ideology and a governing blueprint. For AP analysis, the text reveals the causes of China's communist revolution (the ideological argument that made communism necessary) and the logic that would drive the consequences (including the economic policies of the Great Leap Forward, which followed the same logic of state control applied at maximum intensity). Mao's framing is important for the AP skill of sourcing: who wrote this, for what purpose, and what does the perspective reveal?",
    text: "The Chinese people have had considerable experience of the democratic system of the West and know that it is nothing but another name for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. So-called 'democracy' serves only the capitalists; it does not serve the working people. The Communist Party of China agrees with the political stand, principles, and policies put forward by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and uses the Marxist-Leninist view of world affairs as the telescopic sight with which to observe the destiny of mankind and to judge our own destiny. The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. For it is only the working class that is most far-sighted, most selfless, and most thoroughly revolutionary. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, revolution fails; with the leadership of the working class, revolution triumphs.",

The forests were stripped. The farming tools were gone. The harvest rotted in fields that could not be plowed. The reported steel output reached record levels.
