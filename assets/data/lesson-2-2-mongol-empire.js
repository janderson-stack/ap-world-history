    intro: "William of Rubruck was a Flemish Franciscan friar who traveled to the court of the Mongol Khan Möngke in 1253–1255. His account, written for King Louis IX of France, is one of the most detailed European descriptions of the Mongol Empire. This adapted passage reflects his observations of Mongol governance and religious tolerance.",
    text: "The Khan's court was a place of many nations and many tongues. I saw there men of Russia, of Armenia, of Georgia, of Hungary, and of the Latin church, as well as followers of Muhammad and of the Buddha. The Khan himself questioned me about the faith of the Franks, and I answered him as best I could. He told me that he respected all who prayed to God sincerely, whatever their manner. His scribes kept records in several languages, and his messengers could travel the length of his empire with fresh horses waiting at every station. No merchant traveled without the Khan's seal of permission, but those who carried it moved freely and in safety.",

      "What does William of Rubruck's account reveal about how the Mongols governed a multiethnic, multireligious empire?",
      "How does the Yam postal system described in this source help explain the functioning of the Pax Mongolica?",
      "What is William's perspective as a European Christian friar, and how might that shape what he notices and what he leaves out?"
