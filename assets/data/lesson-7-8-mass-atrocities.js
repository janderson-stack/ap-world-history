    title: "Primary Source: Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948), Article II",
    intro: "After the Holocaust, the international community sought to define genocide in law so that it could be recognized, prevented, and punished. In 1948, the United Nations adopted the Genocide Convention — the first human rights treaty approved by the General Assembly. Article II defines genocide not by scale but by intent: the deliberate attempt to destroy a group in whole or in part. Read the definition as a consequence of the atrocities you have studied — and as an attempt to prevent future ones.",
    text: "In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.",
    questions: [
      "The Convention defines genocide by intent — 'committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part.' Why does the definition focus on intent rather than on the number of victims? How does this legal definition help distinguish genocide from other forms of mass violence?",
      "Apply Article II to one of the illustrative examples (the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, the Holodomor, Cambodia, or Rwanda). Which specific clause — (a) through (e) — most directly describes what happened in your chosen case? Use evidence from the lecture cards.",
      "The Genocide Convention was adopted in 1948, after the Holocaust. But the Armenian Genocide occurred decades earlier, and the Rwandan Genocide occurred decades later. What does the gap between the Convention's adoption and the continued occurrence of genocide suggest about the relationship between international law and the prevention of mass atrocities?"
