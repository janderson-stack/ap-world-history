// Topic 7.9 — Causation in Global Conflict
// RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE: all College Board CED text below is verbatim from the
// AP World History: Modern CED and must not be paraphrased or truncated.
//
// THEMATIC FOCUS: The CED provides NO thematic focus for Topic 7.9. The
// collegeBoardKeyConcepts array below opens directly with the Learning
// Objective, with no Thematic Focus entry — do not add one.
//
// MODULE STRUCTURE: Topic 7.9 is the Unit 7 capstone. Module 09 is the
// Causation Matrix, a synthesis module providing the sixth capture point.
// lesson.modules is set as a custom 10-module array; the renderer's
// defaultModules() is bypassed.
//
// KC COUNT: 13 Key Concepts exactly. Do not add KC-6.2.I.B or KC-6.3 series.
// No illustrative examples block for this topic.
//
// HIGH-RISK VERBATIM FLAGS (verified against CED working copy):
//   KC-6.1.III.C.ii — quotation marks around "total war" are verbatim CED.
//   KC-6.2.IV.B.ii — "especially" and "engendered by" are verbatim CED.
//   KC-6.2.IV.A.ii — "colonies or former colonies" and second sentence on
//     ideologies/totalitarian repression are verbatim CED.
//   KC-6.2.I.A — "eventually led to communist revolution" is verbatim CED.
//   KC-6.2.II.D — "political crisis" end phrase is verbatim CED.
