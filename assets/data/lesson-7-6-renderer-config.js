// RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE: all College Board CED text below is verbatim from the
// AP World History: Modern CED and must not be paraphrased or truncated.
// NOTE: the thematic focus is GOV (Governance), unchanged from Topic 7.5.
// Topic 7.6 has NO CED illustrative examples — there is intentionally no
// illustrativeExamples structure on any Key Concept entry below (the shared
// renderer renders the examples block only when the array is non-empty, so an
// empty group is omitted entirely rather than carried over from 7.5). The KC is
// a single long sentence: it must survive verbatim, including the word
// "especially" (the CED's own causal weighting) and the phrase "engendered by".

    title: 'BeSurreal: When Money Was Cheaper Than Firewood',
    text: 'Before the Depression even arrived, the Versailles reparations helped drive Germany into the hyperinflation of 1923 — a collapse so total that money stopped behaving like money. A loaf of bread that cost 250 marks in early 1923 cost 200 billion marks by November. Workers were paid twice a day and shopped on their lunch break before prices doubled again. People papered their walls with banknotes because wallpaper cost more; they burned bundles of cash in their stoves because it was cheaper than buying firewood; children built block towers and flew kites out of bricks of money no longer worth carrying to the store. A wheelbarrow of cash could be stolen — by dumping out the worthless money and taking the wheelbarrow.',
    prompt: 'Hyperinflation wiped out the savings of millions of ordinary Germans and taught them that their government could not protect the most basic thing money is supposed to do — hold its value. How does an experience like this help explain why a humiliated, economically broken population became "fertile ground for radical political movements"?'

    intro: 'Topic 7.6 is a causation topic where the framework has already done some of the arguing for you: the Key Concept names four causes but ranks one with the word "especially." A weak answer lists the four causes; a strong one weighs them — distinguishing the deeper background conditions from the immediate trigger, and taking a defensible position on which mattered most. Build the argument below.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Name the four causes (with evidence)', text: 'Lay out the CED\'s causes with specifics: (1) the unsustainable peace — Versailles\' reparations, territorial losses, and war-guilt clause; (2) the global economic crisis engendered by the Great Depression — unemployment that discredited democracies; (3) continued imperialist aspirations — aggressive militarism by Germany, Italy, and Japan; (4) and especially the rise of fascist and totalitarian regimes — Nazi Germany under Hitler rearming and expanding.' },
      { label: 'Separate background from trigger', text: 'Sort the causes by type. Versailles and the Depression are long-term BACKGROUND CONDITIONS — they created grievance and desperation but did not, by themselves, start a war. The rise of the Nazi regime and its aggressive militarism is the PROXIMATE cause — the actor that converted conditions into invasions. The CED\'s "especially" is a claim that the trigger mattered more than the conditions.' },
      { label: 'Take and defend a position', text: 'Finish with a judgment, not a shrug. Defend the CED ("without Hitler\'s regime, the grievances of Versailles and the pain of the Depression need not have produced a world war") — or push back ("without the failed peace and the Depression, Hitler never rises; the conditions made the trigger possible"). Either way, name your criterion for "most significant" and argue it. That is exactly the move the 7.9 capstone will demand.' }
