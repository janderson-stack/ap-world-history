    intro: 'You are a Rajput Hindu nobleman who has accepted a mansabdar rank from the Mughal Emperor Akbar. You hold a rank of 1,000 (mansab), which means you must maintain and present 1,000 cavalry soldiers when called upon. In exchange, you have been assigned a jagir — the right to collect revenue from a designated territory in Rajasthan. You speak Persian at court, maintain your Hindu religious practices in private, and serve alongside Muslim, Hindu, and Central Asian commanders in a single imperial army.',
    detail: 'Your situation is neither prisoner nor free lord. You accepted the rank because refusing would mean losing your kingdom — but accepting means your lands are technically imperial grants, revocable at the emperor\'s pleasure. Your son will not automatically inherit your rank or your jagir. You are part of a system designed to make you depend on the emperor rather than on your own inherited wealth. Yet within that system, you have real power, real status, and real revenue. Akbar has treated your religious practices with respect — he has even abolished the jizya tax on non-Muslims — and you have come to see the Mughal system as compatible with your identity, even if you did not choose it freely.',
