    title: 'BeSurreal: The Secret War of the Famous Authors',
    text: 'In September 1914, the British government quietly summoned the most famous writers in the English language to a building called Wellington House — Arthur Conan Doyle, H.G. Wells, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, and more than twenty others. Their mission: write pamphlets, articles, and books supporting the war, published through ordinary commercial presses so readers would never suspect government involvement. Wellington House produced over a thousand propaganda publications, and its existence stayed secret for years. Some of the most "independent" voices of the war were, in fact, the state speaking through its novelists.',

    title: 'HIPP a Propaganda Poster: Reading Persuasion as Evidence',
    intro: 'Topic 7.3 hands you a gift for the AP exam: propaganda is the perfect source for practicing HIPP analysis — Historical situation, Intended audience, Purpose, and Point of view. A propaganda poster is never a neutral window onto the war; it is a weapon aimed at its audience, and your job is to analyze the aim. Work through the Kitchener "Your Country Needs You" poster (or Uncle Sam) with the steps below.',
    steps: [
      { label: 'Historical situation', text: 'Britain, 1914: no conscription until 1916, so the army depended entirely on volunteers — at the exact moment machine guns and trench warfare began consuming men faster than any war in history. The poster exists because the state needed bodies and could not yet compel them.' },
      { label: 'Intended audience & purpose', text: 'Audience: young men of military age — and, just as deliberately, the families and communities watching whether they enlisted. Purpose: convert enlistment from a choice into a personal, patriotic obligation. The pointing finger and direct address ("YOU") collapse the distance between the state and one individual reader.' },
      { label: 'Point of view & limitation', text: 'The poster embodies the government’s point of view: war as duty and honor, with the costs invisible — no trenches, no gas, no casualty lists. That silence is evidence too: compare it with Wilfred Owen’s "old Lie" to see exactly what official persuasion omitted. A strong essay uses the poster as evidence of mobilization strategy, never as evidence of what war was actually like.' }
    ],
    prompt: 'Choose one propaganda poster from this lesson (Kitchener or Uncle Sam). In two to three sentences, analyze it using at least two HIPP elements — historical situation, intended audience, purpose, or point of view — and explain how the poster served the government’s total-war mobilization.'
