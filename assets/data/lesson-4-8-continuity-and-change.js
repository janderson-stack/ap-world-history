And what persisted from earlier patterns? The AP CCOT skill requires evidence on both sides.",

        bullets: [
          "The single most important economic change of c. 1450–1750 was the **connection of the Americas to the Eastern Hemisphere** — creating for the first time a trade network that genuinely linked all inhabited continents. The mechanism was American silver. Silver from **Potosí** (modern Bolivia) flowed east to **Seville** via the Atlantic and west to **Manila** via the trans-Pacific **Manila Galleon trade** (1565–1815), where Chinese merchants exchanged it for silk, porcelain, and spices.",
          "This global circuit worked because of **Chinese demand**: the **Single Whip Tax Reform** (1581) required Chinese subjects to pay taxes in silver rather than grain or labor, creating enormous demand that pulled silver across the Pacific. Chinese demand drove the entire global economy — which means that understanding global trade transformation requires understanding Chinese fiscal policy, not just European expansion.",
          "The **global price revolution** was the most disruptive economic consequence: the huge increase in silver supply caused prices to roughly triple in Western Europe between 1500 and 1650, disrupting existing economic relationships, accelerating the decline of feudal obligations, and benefiting merchants and debtors while harming those on fixed incomes. Spain — which received the most silver — was paradoxically weakened by it: the influx allowed monarchs to borrow against future silver revenues without fiscal discipline, leading to repeated state bankruptcies.",
          "This trade circuit was **genuinely new**: nothing like the Manila Galleon trade had existed before 1565. But it built on existing networks — Chinese manufacturing, Indian Ocean trade infrastructure, and pre-existing commercial relationships between Asian merchants. European ships were the connective tissue; Asian demand was the engine."

          "The **Columbian Exchange** caused the largest population collapse in recorded human history. Smallpox, measles, influenza, and other Old World diseases killed an estimated **50–90% of the indigenous population of the Americas** in the century after 1492 — from perhaps 50–100 million people to as few as 5–10 million. This was not a single event but a series of overlapping epidemics that swept through populations with no prior exposure and therefore no immunological resistance.",
          "The demographic collapse was the **enabling condition** for European conquest (not the primary cause — military technology and indigenous alliances also mattered, but disease made conquest feasible at the scale it occurred); the **direct cause of the Atlantic slave trade** (the labor vacuum created by population collapse drove demand for enslaved African labor); and an enormous **environmental transformation** (abandoned agricultural land reverted to secondary forest, which early European visitors mistook for pristine wilderness).",
          "The Columbian Exchange also moved crops in both directions. From the Americas to the Eastern Hemisphere: **maize (corn), potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, tomatoes, and chili peppers** — all of which eventually transformed agriculture globally. The potato became a staple in Ireland and northern Europe; maize spread across Africa and China; cassava became a staple across sub-Saharan Africa. These crops enabled population growth in several world regions by c. 1700–1750.",
          "From the Eastern Hemisphere to the Americas: **horses** (which transformed indigenous cultures of the Great Plains within a generation of the Pueblo Revolt); **cattle and pigs** (which damaged indigenous agricultural systems); **wheat and rice** (which European colonists cultivated on lands cleared of indigenous agriculture). The ecological transformation of the Americas was comprehensive and largely irreversible."

          "Despite the transformations of c. 1450–1750, the **Indian Ocean trade system continued** — and in many respects grew. Arab, Indian, Chinese, Malay, and Swahili merchants continued to trade throughout the Indian Ocean; the Portuguese Estado da India extracted tolls but never replaced existing networks; the Dutch VOC displaced the Portuguese but did not eliminate Asian merchant activity. By c. 1700, the Indian Ocean trade was larger in volume than in c. 1450 — European demand had added to it, not replaced it.",
          "**China remained the world's largest economy** throughout this period — producing the most silk, porcelain, and cotton textiles, attracting the most silver, and driving the most commercial activity. Chinese manufacturing dominance was a powerful continuity. In fact, Chinese demand for silver was the engine that drove the Manila Galleon trade — which means that China's economic size was itself a cause of the period's most significant changes. The AP key: Asia did not passively receive the effects of European expansion; Asian economic logic drove European decisions.",
          "**Islamic commercial networks** persisted across the Indian Ocean and overland routes. Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal merchants operated extensive trade networks; Islamic commercial law (the *hawala* credit system, partnership contracts, insurance instruments) facilitated long-distance trade; and Muslim traders remained important intermediaries between Southeast Asian spice producers and Indian Ocean markets. The Portuguese and Dutch disrupted some nodes in these networks but could not replace them.",
          "**Social hierarchies adapted** without disappearing. Indigenous elites in Spanish America retained some status under colonial law; existing Javanese hierarchies were incorporated into the VOC commercial system; Ottoman and Mughal administrative hierarchies continued to function. The period produced enormous change at the top of social orders while many underlying structures of daily life, family organization, and local governance continued."

    text: "The city of Manila is the great meeting place of the trade of the East and of New Spain. Each year the Chinese merchants — whom we call the Sangleys — come in their junks from the ports of Fujian and Guangdong, bringing silks of every kind, fine porcelains, iron goods, and spices from the islands to the south. They come in such numbers and with such quantities of goods that the warehouses of Manila cannot contain them all. For all of this they require silver — nothing else will satisfy them. They will not take cloth, nor wine, nor manufactured goods of any kind that we might offer in exchange. Only silver, which they carry back to China in their junks. Without the silver of New Spain, there would be no trade at Manilafor there is nothing else that the Chinese will take. And without the Chinese goods, the people of New Spain and of Spain itself would lack the silk and porcelain that they demand. The whole commerce of the Pacific rests upon this exchange, and it rests upon silver as its foundation.",
