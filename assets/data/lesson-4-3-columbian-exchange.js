    title: "The Great Exchange: Crops, Disease, and Global Transformation",
    intro: "Use these cards to explain how the biological contact between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres after 1492 produced three interconnected transformations: a global exchange of crops and animals that changed diets and populations worldwide, a catastrophic epidemic that killed the majority of the indigenous American population, and economic and social consequences that created the conditions for the Atlantic slave trade and global capitalism.",

          "**New World crops moving east** transformed Afro-Eurasian agriculture and demographics. The **potato** — calorie-dense, easily grown in cool northern climates — became a dietary staple in Ireland, Germany, and Russia, supporting population growth in regions where wheat had struggled. **Maize** (corn) became a staple across sub-Saharan Africa and parts of China, providing calories in environments where other grains were unreliable. **Tomatoes** transformed Italian and Mediterranean cuisine. **Cacao** became chocolate. **Tobacco** became a global commodity.",
          "**Old World introductions moving west** transformed the Americas with equal force. The **horse** — absent from the Americas since the Ice Age — arrived with the Spanish and within a century had been adopted by indigenous Plains peoples, transforming cultures like the Comanche, Lakota, and Cheyenne into highly mobile equestrian societies based on buffalo hunting. **Cattle, pigs, and sheep** provided new protein sources but also consumed native vegetation, beginning the transformation of American grasslands.",
          "**Sugarcane** — originally from New Guinea, cultivated across the Islamic world, introduced to the Americas by Columbus — proved enormously profitable in Caribbean and Brazilian plantations. Sugar's profitability drove demand for intensive labor that indigenous populations could not supply (due to demographic collapse) and created the primary economic engine of the Atlantic slave trade.",
          "The crop exchange was not symmetric in its effects: New World crops generally increased populations in regions where they spread, while Old World introductions (especially animals and pathogens) decimated populations in the Americas. The net demographic effect of the Columbian Exchange was to dramatically increase Afro-Eurasian populations over the long term while devastating the Americas in the short and medium term."

          "The most devastating consequence of hemispheric contact was disease. Afro-Eurasian populations had lived with **smallpox, measles, influenza, typhus, and bubonic plague** for millennia, and while these diseases were deadly, most populations had acquired some degree of immunity through generations of exposure. Indigenous American populations had no such exposure — no immunity, no evolved defenses, no prior encounter with any of these pathogens.",
          "A **'virgin soil epidemic'** occurs when a disease enters a population with no prior exposure: the disease spreads explosively and kills at far higher rates than in populations with any immunity. Smallpox in an unexposed population could kill 30–50% of everyone it infected. When multiple diseases arrived simultaneously — as happened in the Americas after 1492 — the cumulative death toll was catastrophic.",
          "**Tenochtitlan, 1520**: a smallpox epidemic brought by soldiers in Hernán Cortés's army swept through the Aztec capital before the Spanish military conquest was complete. The disease killed Emperor Cuitláhuac (who died of smallpox eighty days after taking power) and devastated the city's population and its ability to organize resistance. The siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521 was in significant part completed against a population already weakened by epidemic disease.",
          "The scale of the catastrophe defies easy comprehension: historians estimate that **50–90% of indigenous American populations died within the century following European contact** — from a pre-contact population that may have been 50–70 million people. This demographic collapse was not primarily caused by European military violence; it was caused by pathogens that traveled invisibly ahead of any army, killing populations that had no defense against them."

The **encomienda system** — which had granted Spanish colonists rights to indigenous labor — became unworkable as populations collapsed.",
          "The solution was the **Atlantic slave trade**. Beginning with the Portuguese in the 1440s, European slavers transported approximately **12 million enslaved Africans** to the Americas between c. 1500 and c. 1850 — one of the largest forced migrations in human history. The primary driver was labor demand in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and silver-mining operations that required intensive work that colonists themselves were unwilling to perform and that epidemic disease had made indigenous populations unable to provide.",
          "**American silver** — particularly from the enormous silver deposits at **Potosí** in modern Bolivia (discovered 1545) — transformed global trade. Spanish silver flowed eastward through trade networks to China, which needed silver to pay taxes under the Ming fiscal system, creating a global trade circuit connecting the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The influx of American silver caused significant inflation across the Spanish Empire and disrupted the monetary systems of much of the Old World.",
          "**Environmental transformation** accompanied human demographic change: introduced livestock overgrazed native vegetation; introduced Old World weeds and plants replaced native species; the depopulation of previously farmed land allowed forest regrowth across vast areas of the Americas. European observers in the 17th and 18th centuries who described 'virgin wilderness' were often looking at land that had been actively farmed and managed for centuries before epidemic disease had removed its human inhabitants."

Book 12 describes the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlan, including the smallpox epidemic of 1520. This adapted passage reflects the Nahuatl account of the epidemic.",
    text: "Before the Spanish appeared to us, first there came to be prevalent a great sickness, a plague. It was in Tepeilhuitl that it originated, that it spread over the people, and it greatly afflicted them. It covered many people; it spread over them everywhere. It caused great havoc among them; many people died of it. They could not walk; they only lay in their resting places and beds. They could not move; they could not stir; they could not change position, nor lie on one side, nor face down, nor on their backs. And if they stirred, much did they cry out. Great was its destruction. Covered, mantled with pustules, very many people died of them. And very many starved; there was death from hunger, for none could take care of the sick; nothing could be done for them. And on some the pustules were widely separated; they suffered not greatly, neither did many of them die. Yet many people's faces were spoiled; some lost an eye, others were blinded.",

    intro: "You trained for years in the calmecac to learn the healing arts — the properties of hundreds of plants, the signs and symptoms of every illness you have ever encountered, the prayers and rituals that accompany treatment, the careful observation of the body that distinguishes one sickness from another. You have treated wounds, fever, dysentery, broken bones. You have studied the codices that describe how the gods send illness and how healers respond.",

It spreads not through wounds or contaminated water but through the air itself, through proximity, through touch. You cannot protect yourself by keeping away from the sick; the sick are everywhere. The pustules are unlike anything in any codex you have studied. People who were healthy yesterday are prostrate today, covered in sores, unable to move or eat or drink.

You cannot stop this. And somewhere in the city, the Spanish are regrouping.",
