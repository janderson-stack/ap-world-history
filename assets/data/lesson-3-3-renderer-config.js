    steps: [
      { label: 'Identify the strategies', text: 'Akbar used tolerance — abolishing jizya, including Hindu elites, developing Din-i-Ilahi. Aurangzeb used enforcement — reimposing jizya, destroying temples, enforcing Sunni law. Shah Ismail used coercive conversion — creating a Shia identity state.' },
      { label: 'Evaluate the outcomes', text: 'Akbar expanded Mughal power by drawing diverse elites into the imperial project. Aurangzeb\'s enforcement provoked rebellions that weakened Mughal authority. Shah Ismail\'s Shia identity strengthened internal loyalty but intensified Ottoman-Safavid conflict.' },
      { label: 'Build your argument', text: 'A strong argument acknowledges complexity: neither tolerance nor enforcement was universally effective. The key is explaining which conditions made each approach more or less viable — empire size, religious composition of the population, and external threats all mattered.' }
    ],
    prompt: 'Write a claim (one sentence) that evaluates whether religious tolerance or religious enforcement was more effective as an imperial governing strategy. Then support your claim with at least two pieces of specific evidence from c. 1450–c. 1750.'
