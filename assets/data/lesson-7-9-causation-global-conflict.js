It bounced off the car and exploded under the vehicle behind it, injuring two officers but leaving the Archduke unharmed. Rattled but unhurt, Franz Ferdinand continued to his schedule, and the would-be assassins thought they had failed. Hours later, the Archduke decided to visit the injured officers at the hospital. His motorcade set off again — and the driver, not told of the route change, took a wrong turn. He realized his mistake, hit the brakes, and the car stalled directly in front of the delicatessen where Gavrilo Princip was standing, eating a sandwich, certain his chance had passed. From point-blank range, Princip fired twice. The world went to war.",
