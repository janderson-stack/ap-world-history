    title: "Why They Sailed: European Exploration, 1415–1522",

          "By c. 1450, the **Ottoman conquest of Constantinople** (1453) had disrupted overland trade routes through which Asian spices, silk, and luxury goods reached Europe through Arab and Byzantine middlemen. Spices — pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon — were enormously valuable in Europe for food preservation, medicine, and luxury consumption. But every spice bought in Europe had passed through layers of middlemen, each taking a share. Finding a direct sea route to Asian spice markets would allow European merchants to bypass the entire system.",
          "**Portugal and Spain** had both just completed the **Reconquista** — the centuries-long campaign to expel Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula (completed 1492 in Spain). That campaign had produced military institutions, a warrior nobility, and a crusading religious ideology that could be redirected toward Atlantic expansion. Exploring and 'discovering' new lands offered the Spanish and Portuguese crowns a way to convert souls, claim territory, and project power without the constraints of established European politics.",
          "**Prince Henry the Navigator** (1394–1460) organized Portuguese exploration of the African coast from his court at Sagres — not sailing himself but systematically sponsoring voyages year by year, gathering geographic and commercial intelligence. His motives combined the commercial (find gold and spice routes), the religious (find the legendary Christian kingdom of Prester John as an ally against Islam), and the political (establish Portuguese maritime dominance). The Portuguese model was state-sponsored, systematic, and cumulative.",
          "The shorthand **'God, Glory, and Gold'** captures the three overlapping European motivations: religious conversion and crusading ideology, national prestige and competition between states, and commercial profit from trade and extraction. In practice, these motivations reinforced each other: conquering territory could bring both souls to convert and wealth to extract."

          "The Portuguese systematically explored the African coast southward from 1415, establishing a series of trading posts (**feitorias**) along the West African coast. Each voyage extended the known coastline by a few hundred miles, with the geographic knowledge recorded in portolan charts and brought back to Lisbon. By 1471, the Portuguese had reached the equator; by 1482, they had established a major fort at Elmina (modern Ghana), trading for gold and enslaved Africans.",
          "**Bartolomeu Dias** rounded the **Cape of Good Hope** in 1488 — the southern tip of Africa — proving that a sea route to the Indian Ocean was possible from the Atlantic. Dias's crew forced him to turn back before he could continue to India, but the critical geographic fact was established: Africa had a southern end, and the ocean beyond it connected to Asia.",
          "**Vasco da Gama** completed the voyage in 1498, reaching **Calicut** (Kozhikode) on the southwestern coast of India. He returned with enough spices to cover his entire voyage cost sixty times over — a commercial return that electrified European investors and confirmed the viability of the eastern sea route. Portugal subsequently established a network of fortified trading posts across the Indian Ocean, using naval power to control key straits and ports.",
          "The Portuguese model was extractive and militaristic: they did not primarily colonize territory but seized control of existing trade routes by force, threatening established Arab, Indian, and Swahili traders. This created enormous wealth for Portugal but also provoked resistance across the Indian Ocean world."

          "**Christopher Columbus** (sailing for Spain, 1492) proposed reaching Asia by sailing *west* across the Atlantic — a gamble based on a significant underestimate of the earth's circumference. On October 12, 1492, he landed in the **Bahamas**, where he encountered the **Taíno people**. Columbus never accepted that he had found unknown continents; he died in 1506 still believing he had reached islands off the Asian coast. The **Treaty of Tordesillas** (1494) divided the non-European world between Spain and Portugal: everything west of a line in the Atlantic went to Spain, everything east went to Portugal.",
          "Spanish **conquistadors** followed Columbus with remarkable speed: within 30 years, Hernán Cortés had destroyed the **Aztec Empire** (1521) and Francisco Pizarro the **Inca Empire** (1532). The Spanish conquest was enabled by military technology, alliances with indigenous peoples who were enemies of these empires, and — crucially — by disease. Smallpox arrived in Mesoamerica with Cortés's army in 1519 and killed an estimated 30–50% of the Aztec population before the military conquest was complete.",
          "**Ferdinand Magellan** (sailing for Spain, 1519–1522) led the first circumnavigation of the globe — proving that the Pacific Ocean was vastly larger than Columbus had imagined and that the Americas were entirely separate from Asia. Magellan was killed in the Philippines in 1521; only one ship and 18 of 270 crew members completed the voyage. The circumnavigation established the global scale of the world and created the conditions for sustained Spanish competition with Portugal for Pacific trade routes.",
          "From the **Taíno perspective**, Columbus's arrival was the beginning of catastrophe. Within 50 years of first contact, the Taíno population of Hispaniola had been reduced from an estimated 250,000 to near extinction — killed by disease, violence, and forced labor. The **encomienda system** enslaved indigenous peoples for Spanish labor needs. The Treaty of Tordesillas — drawn without any consultation of non-European peoples — reflected a European assumption that the world existed to be divided by European powers."

About two hours after midnight they saw a light, and at two hours past midnight they saw land clearly. Friday, 12 October. At dawn they saw people, naked, on the shore. The Admiral went ashore in the armed boat, and with him the royal standard. He called to the two captains to be witnesses that he was taking possession of this island for the King and Queen of Castile. They saw many trees, very green, and many streams, and fruits of various kinds. The people all went naked as their mothers bore them. They are very well built, with very handsome bodies and very good faces, and their hair coarse, almost like the tail of a horse. They are friendly and well-dispositioned people who bear no arms except for small spears. I showed one of them a sword and through ignorance he grabbed it by the blade and cut himself. They should be good and intelligent servants, for I see that they say very quickly everything that is said to them. I believe that they could easily be made Christians, for it seemed to me that they had no religion of their own.",

You have been at sea before, always within sight of the European coast. This has been nothing like that. For 33 days, no land. The compass has behaved strangely. The winds carried you west so steadily that men began to whisper that they might never carry you back east. You have eaten dried meat and biscuit until you cannot taste anything. You have dreamed about water that doesn't move. Columbus has been wrong about the distance before — he told the crew the crossing would be short, and it has been anything but.
