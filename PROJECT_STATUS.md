## BeInTheRoom

### Theme-Alignment Hard Rule (codified 2026-06-12)

The **Step 0 — Theme Alignment Gate** is now codified in [`docs/beintheroom-scenario-blueprint.md`](docs/beintheroom-scenario-blueprint.md), preceding the existing scenario-requirement steps. Before drafting any scenario, the topic's CED thematic focus / learning objective pairs must be stated, and the premise AND decision points must directly enact at least one listed pair. A central dilemma that survives transplant to a different topic without changing the theme it exercises fails the gate. Every future BeInTheRoom build (including the 23 scenarios currently referenced by Unit 2–7 lessons but not yet built) must clear Step 0 first.

### Theme-Alignment Audit (2026-06-12)

Full report: [`docs/beintheroom-theme-audit.md`](docs/beintheroom-theme-audit.md). All nine existing scenarios (all in `beintheroom/unit-1/`) were audited against the Step 0 gate. No scenario HTML was edited.

| BeInTheRoom scenario | `beintheroom/unit-8/empire-accounts.html` | DONE |
| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.1 card href updated) | DONE |

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "caught between superpowers" — London, February 1947, PM Attlee's cabinet facing simultaneous crises in India, Greece/Turkey, and Palestine. Decision points require reasoning from 1947 knowledge (no hindsight framing). Continuity hooks to Topics 8.5–8.6 (Nehru, Nkrumah).

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.2.II (imperial exhaustion → dissolution of empires) and KC-6.2.IV.C.i (superpower balance of power shift). All four decision options exercise Governance/state-formation pairs from the CED thematic focus.

| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.2 card href updated) | DONE |

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "The Bandung Table" — Bandung, Indonesia, April 1955, as a senior advisor in Sukarno's foreign ministry during the first Afro-Asian Conference (29 nations). Decision points: formal non-aligned bloc vs. loose principles forum; acceptance of superpower aid with conditions; how hard to condemn all colonialism (including Soviet). Four roles: Indonesian Foreign Ministry advisor, Indian Panchsheel delegate (Nehru), West African Pan-African observer (Nkrumah continuity hook), Pakistani military diplomat (SEATO-aligned, creates tension).

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.2.V.B (groups and individuals, including the Non-Aligned Movement, opposing and promoting alternatives to existing orders). The Bandung setting cannot be transplanted without changing the CDI theme it exercises.

### Topic 8.3 — Effects of the Cold War (built 2026-06-25)

| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.3 card href updated) | DONE |

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "The Luanda Decision" — Luanda, Angola, November 1975, as a senior advisor within the MPLA leadership circle with independence day approaching and South African forces advancing from the south, FNLA from the north. Three decisions: accept Cuban troops and Soviet arms; pursue quiet U.S. recognition talks; appeal to the OAU and Bandung-era principles. Four roles: MPLA Political Commissar, Angolan Nationalist Intellectual, Cuban Liaison Officer, OAU Secretary-General Liaison.

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.2.IV.D (proxy wars between and within postcolonial states in Africa) and LO C (compare how U.S. and Soviet Union sought to maintain influence). The Angolan Independence Day setting is the moment where both superpowers' methods are simultaneously visible and the student must reason through the comparison from the inside. Continuity hook to Bandung 1955 (Topic 8.2): the reflection prompt explicitly asks whether the non-alignment promise survives contact with a real war.

### Topic 8.4 — Spread of Communism After 1900 (built 2026-06-25)

| BeInTheRoom scenario | `beintheroom/unit-8/harvest-report.html` | DONE |
| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.4 card href updated) | DONE |

**Dual-LO topic structure:** Topic 8.4 carries two thematic focus / LO pairs — ECN / LO D (China's adoption of communism: KC-6.2.I.i and KC-6.3.I.A.ii) and SIO / LO E (redistribution movements: KC-6.2.II.D.i with all four illustrative examples verbatim). Both pairs are represented in `lesson-8-4-spread-of-communism.js` `collegeBoardKeyConcepts` array (7 entries) and reproduced verbatim in `lesson-8-4-renderer-config.js`. Renderer constraint finding: `normalizedKeyConcepts()` iterates the full array with no entry-count limit; both pairs and all four illustrative examples render via standard `cb-card` elements with no renderer modification required.

**Checkpoint structure for dual-LO:** CP1 covers LT3 / LO E (redistribution movements — causes and effects of at least two CED examples); CP2 covers LT1+LT2 / LO D (China causation — both causes of 1949 revolution and consequences of Great Leap Forward).

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "The Harvest Report" — Henan Province, China, autumn 1959, as the county party secretary holding an autumn harvest report showing 40% of the spring-reported figure. Decision points require reasoning from inside the system (pressure from party above + villages below), not between competing nations or factions. Three decisions: (a) what to report to the province; (b) what to submit to grain procurement quota; (c) what to tell the villages. Four roles: County Party Secretary, Village Production Team Leader, Provincial Agricultural Inspector, County Agricultural Bureau Chief. Frame explicitly breaks the "caught between superpowers" structure used in 8.1–8.3 — this is "caught inside the system."

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.3.I.A.ii (communist government control of national economy through Great Leap Forward, repressive policies, negative repercussions for population). The county party secretary's dilemma IS the CED key concept made visible from inside the system. Cannot be transplanted to a different topic without changing the ECN theme it exercises. Reflection prompt explicitly bridges both LO D KCs: asks students to explain the gap between the causes of China's communist revolution (1949 promises) and the consequences of communist government (1959 famine), connecting KC-6.2.I.i and KC-6.3.I.A.ii.

### Topic 8.5 — Decolonization After 1900 (built 2026-06-25)

| BeInTheRoom scenario | `beintheroom/unit-8/positive-action.html` | DONE |
| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.5 card href updated) | DONE |

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "Positive Action" — Accra, Gold Coast, January 1950, as a senior strategist in Nkrumah's Convention People's Party. The CPP is deciding whether to launch Positive Action (nonviolent strikes and boycotts) against the British colonial government, which has offered limited constitutional reforms through the Coussey Committee. Three decisions: (a) method — launch full Positive Action, limited strike with safety valves, accept Coussey reforms, or threaten escalation to armed resistance; (b) response to Nkrumah's certain arrest; (c) Cold War positioning to prevent the communist-subversion label. Four roles: CPP Political Strategist, UGCC Moderate, Gold Coast Market Woman, British Colonial Secretary's Advisor. 12 evidence chips: Accra riots 1948, Indian precedent (INC/Gandhi/1947), CPP mass organizational base, Coussey Report, Indochina cost (armed struggle), Cold War framing risk, cocoa economy leverage, 1945 Manchester Pan-African Congress, British post-war politics (Labour/war-weariness), Nkrumah's certain arrest, Gold Coast electorate, CPP-UGCC split.

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.2.II.A (Kwame Nkrumah in British Gold Coast seeking independence) and LO F (compare processes by which peoples pursued independence after 1900). The Accra/January 1950 CPP strategist setting cannot be transplanted without changing the GOV/comparison theme it exercises. Reflection prompt explicitly requires comparison with Algeria or Vietnam (armed struggle cases from KC-6.2.II.B), feeding Checkpoint 2's comparison requirement.

**Continuity hooks:** Nkrumah's third recurrence across Unit 8 — referenced as background figure in 8.1 (empire exhaustion context), present at the Bandung Table in 8.2 (Pan-African observer role), now central protagonist in 8.5 (his own independence struggle). Ho Chi Minh from 8.4 appears as a comparison reference in the evidence bank (Indochina cost chip). Reflection prompt looks forward to Ghana 1957 and Topic 8.6 (newly independent states).

**CED text constraints:** All verbatim CED text reproduced in both `lesson-8-5-decolonization.js` and `lesson-8-5-renderer-config.js` (RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE), including exact KC codes (KC-6.2.II.A, KC-6.2.II.B, KC-6.2.I.C — note KC-6.2.I.C, not KC-6.2.II.C), "British Gold Coast (Ghana)" exact, "French empire" lowercase, "Québécois" with accent.

| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.6 card href updated) | DONE |

**Dual-LO topic structure:** Topic 8.6 carries two thematic focus / LO pairs — GOV / LO G (boundary redrawing → new states + conflict/displacement: KC-6.2.III.A.i and KC-6.2.III.A.ii) and ECN / LO H (economic changes and continuities from decolonization: KC-6.3.I.C with all four illustrative examples verbatim, and KC-6.2.III.B with all three illustrative examples verbatim). Both pairs are represented in `lesson-8-6-newly-independent-states.js` `collegeBoardKeyConcepts` array (8 entries) and reproduced verbatim in `lesson-8-6-renderer-config.js` (RUNTIME-AUTHORITATIVE). Renderer constraint finding: `normalizedKeyConcepts()` iterates the full array with no entry-count limit; both pairs and all examples render via standard `cb-card` elements with no renderer modification required.

**Checkpoint structure for dual-LO:** CP1 covers LT3 / LO H (economic changes and continuities — state-led development examples and migration continuity); CP2 covers LT1+LT2 / LO G (political changes → territorial, demographic, and nationalist developments — new state creation and conflict/displacement from boundary redrawing).

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "A Line Through Punjab" — New Delhi, September 1947, as a senior ICS civil servant advising the Emergency Committee of the Cabinet (chaired by Nehru). Crisis-response variant (matching 8.4 "Harvest Report" structure — inside a system, not between competing nations). Four roles: ICS Senior Advisor, Army Liaison Officer, Rehabilitation Commissioner, India–Pakistan Liaison Officer. 12 evidence chips: scale of movement, Radcliffe Line process, Punjab Boundary Force capacity, communal violence patterns, evacuee property, Nehru's secular-state commitment, camp conditions, Sikh community position, Kashmir shadow, WWII displaced persons precedent, army capacity/split loyalties, world judgment of new state. Three decisions: (a) protection of refugee columns — escort both directions, concentrate on cities, establish military corridors, or request joint BF reinforcement; (b) evacuee property — hold in trust, immediate requisition, bilateral exchange agreement, or defer legislation; (c) coordination with Pakistan — joint emergency machinery, unilateral parallel action, UN/ICRC mediation, or Nehru–Liaquat summit.

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.2.III.A.ii (boundary redrawing → conflict, population displacement, resettlement in the Partition of India) and LO G (political changes leading to territorial, demographic, and nationalist developments). The Emergency Committee / Radcliffe Line / September 1947 setting cannot be transplanted without changing the GOV theme it exercises. Reflection prompt explicitly connects the Radcliffe Line decision to the displacement crisis and requires comparison with Israel/Palestine 1948 (the other KC-6.2.III.A.ii illustrative example).

**Continuity hooks:** Nehru's third recurrence in Unit 8 — background figure in 8.1 (empire exhaustion context), Indian delegation at Bandung in 8.2, now Prime Minister chairing the Emergency Committee in 8.6. Muslim League from 8.5 lecture (demand for Pakistan as separate state) lands here as the partition it produced. Evidence chip "Kashmir shadow" looks forward to Topic 8.7 (resistance and realignment) and the India–Pakistan conflict that follows.

### Topic 8.7 — Global Resistance to Established Power Structures After 1900 (built 2026-06-26)

| BeInTheRoom scenario | `beintheroom/unit-8/after-sharpeville.html` | DONE |
| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.7 card href updated) | DONE |

**Single-LO topic structure:** Topic 8.7 carries one thematic focus / LO pair — CDI / LO I ("Explain various reactions to existing power structures in the period after 1900."). Four KCs: KC-6.2.V (umbrella framing), KC-6.2.V.A (nonviolent challenge — Gandhi, MLK, Mandela named in KC text), KC-6.2.V.C (militarized states intensifying conflict — Chile/Pinochet, Spain/Franco, Uganda/Amin, military–industrial complex with verbatim en dash), KC-6.2.V.D (movements using violence against civilians — Shining Path, Al-Qaeda). `collegeBoardKeyConcepts` array has 6 entries (thematic focus + LO + 4 KCs); `normalizedKeyConcepts()` iterates without count limit — all 6 render correctly with no renderer modification.

**Checkpoint structure:** CP1 covers LT1 / KC-6.2.V.A (nonviolent challenge — explain how at least two of the three named individuals promoted nonviolence and why it was a strategic choice); CP2 covers all LTs / LO I synthesis (explain various reactions using evidence from at least two of the three KC categories — V.A, V.C, V.D).

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "After Sharpeville" — Johannesburg, South Africa, June 1961. Fifteen months after the Sharpeville Massacre, the apartheid state has banned the ANC and imprisoned its leadership. Student is a strategist in the banned ANC's underground leadership circle as the movement debates its path — the real historical debate from which Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) emerged. Four roles: ANC Strategist (Chief Albert Luthuli's inner circle), Luthuli Peace Prize Delegate, Mass Organizer, External Relations Officer. 12 evidence chips: Sharpeville massacre (1960), ANC banning + PAC banning, Luthuli's peace commitment, Gandhian satyagraha origins (South Africa 1906–1915), Indian precedent (1947 independence), Gold Coast precedent (Ghana 1957), state willingness to fire, MK/sabotage idea (property-only framing), Cold War context, international opinion, newly independent Africa as audience, Mandela's organizing life. Three decisions: (a) method — strict nonviolence / allow infrastructure sabotage (no civilian targets) / defer / mass resistance; (b) response to state escalation — continue public / go underground / dual tracks / exile-based; (c) international strategy — sanctions campaign / Afro-Asian bloc focus / internal focus / Cold War neutrality. Design boundary strictly observed: KC-6.2.V.D is lecture-only; Option B in Decision 1 explicitly frames MK as property/infrastructure sabotage, not violence against people.

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — premise directly enacts KC-6.2.V.A (nonviolence debate within ANC — Mandela is a named CED figure in this KC) and KC-6.2.V.C (apartheid state's militarized escalation after Sharpeville narrows the movement's available options). The June 1961 Johannesburg underground leadership setting cannot be transplanted without changing the CDI theme it exercises. Reflection prompt explicitly connects KC-6.2.V.A and KC-6.2.V.C: Part 2 asks how the apartheid state's response (V.C) affected the movement's options (V.A).

**Continuity hooks:** Connects to 8.5 "Positive Action" (Accra 1950 — Gold Coast evidence chip and extension question: "Does the Gold Coast playbook survive contact with a state willing to fire on crowds?"). Mandela's fourth recurrence in Unit 8 — named CED figure in KC-6.2.V.A, evidence chip `mandelalife` in the scenario, protagonist of the historical debate. Extension comparison prompt: Accra 1950 (Nkrumah / Positive Action) vs. Johannesburg 1961 (ANC underground debate).

### Topic 8.8 — End of the Cold War (built 2026-06-26)

| BeInTheRoom scenario | `beintheroom/unit-8/kremlin-ledger.html` | DONE |
| Unit 8 index link | `unit-8/index.html` (Topic 8.8 card href updated) | DONE |

**Single-LO, single-KC topic structure:** Topic 8.8 carries one thematic focus / LO pair — GOV / LO J ("Explain the causes of the end of the Cold War."). One KC: KC-6.2.IV.E ("Advances in U.S. military and technological development, the Soviet Union's costly and ultimately failed invasion of Afghanistan, and public discontent and economic weakness in communist countries led to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union."). `collegeBoardKeyConcepts` array has 3 entries (thematic focus + LO J + KC-6.2.IV.E — NO illustrative examples for any entry). Content figures (Gorbachev, Reagan, SDI, Berlin Wall) are lecture content only; they must never be labeled as CED illustrative examples. This constraint is enforced in the renderer config header comment and codified in `lesson-8-8-renderer-config.js`.

**Three learning targets (three causal strands of KC-6.2.IV.E):** LT1 — U.S. military and technological development (SDI mechanism, microelectronics gap, defense spending spiral); LT2 — Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (direct costs, signal to Eastern European satellites, CIA Operation Cyclone); LT3 — public discontent and economic weakness in communist countries (glasnost/perestroika unintended consequences, 1989 Eastern European revolutions, 1991 Soviet dissolution).

**Checkpoint structure:** CP1 covers LT1+LT2 ("The Two External Pressures" — explain U.S. military/tech AND Afghanistan as two distinct causal mechanisms + how they compounded each other); CP2 covers all LTs / full LO J synthesis ("Explaining the Causes of the End of the Cold War" — at least two causal strands, mechanism for each, explicit significance claim, counterargument to significance claim).

**BeInTheRoom scenario frame:** "The Kremlin Ledger" — Moscow, March 1985, as a senior advisor preparing Gorbachev's first strategic review. Unit 8 frame inversion: after seven topics of peoples caught between the superpowers (8.1–8.7), the student now sits inside one superpower as it strains. Decision points map 1:1 onto the three KC-6.2.IV.E causal strands: D1 (how to respond to SDI and U.S. military buildup) = Strand 1; D2 (what to do in Afghanistan) = Strand 2; D3 (what kind of domestic reform to pursue) = Strand 3. Four roles: Senior KGB Economic Analyst, Deputy Defense Minister, General Staff Officer (Afghanistan), Senior Gosplan Official. 12 evidence chips: `sdiannouncement`, `defenseburden`, `afghancasualties`, `ciasupport`, `consumershortages`, `glasnostconcept`, `pastreforms`, `easterneuropewatch`, `techgap`, `chinacomparison`, `gorbachevmandate`, `afghanexit`. No-hindsight constraint: student reasons from March 1985 only; Soviet dissolution must not be presented as foreseeable. Consequence reveals emphasize tradeoffs and tensions, not a scripted path to collapse.

**Step 0 gate:** PASS — Moscow/March 1985/Gorbachev's first strategic review is the historical moment where all three KC-6.2.IV.E causal strands converge simultaneously. D1 = Strand 1 (U.S. military/tech pressure), D2 = Strand 2 (Afghanistan costs), D3 = Strand 3 (reform vs. public discontent/economic weakness). Cannot be transplanted to a different topic without changing the GOV theme it exercises.

**Continuity hooks:** Extension question explicitly connects to "The Harvest Report" (Topic 8.4, Henan Province 1959) — both scenarios feature a command-economy system where local/national actors face structural resource constraints they cannot admit. The 1959 county party secretary's falsified grain numbers and Gorbachev's 1985 defense-burden dilemma share the same structural logic: a system that cannot produce what it promises. Coaching prompt stage 6 (Harvest Report connection) asks students to articulate this structural continuity across the KC-6.3.I.A.ii / KC-6.2.IV.E bridge.

**UNIT 8 COMPLETE — 9/9 topics built.**

**Capstone topic — 6-module variant (deviation from 10-module standard):** Topic 8.9 is a synthesis/capstone lesson. Per capstone rule, it compresses to synthesis work only: Module 01 (First & 10), Module 02 (Content Delivery jump), Module 03 (Unit Review), Module 04 (Hemispheric Effects Matrix), Module 05 (AP Skill Builder), Module 06 (Checkpoint 2). No Map module, no BeSurreal, no Evidence Lab, no Primary Source, no BeInTheRoom, no Checkpoint 1. The 6-module array is set via `lesson.modules` in the renderer config, which the renderer supports via `L.modules || defaultModules()`.

**CED constraints (Topic 8.9):** No thematic focus block listed for this topic in the CED. Learning Objective K is the only LO: "Explain the extent to which the effects of the Cold War were similar in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres." Five KCs (no illustrative examples for any): KC-6.2 (umbrella), KC-6.2.II (anti-imperialism → dissolution), KC-6.2.IV.C (Cold War extended beyond ideology), KC-6.3 (role of state + new institutions), KC-6.3.I (states responded in a variety of ways). All verbatim in both data file and renderer config.

**Hemispheric Effects Matrix (custom module 04):** 4 rows (economic, political, social, cultural) × 2 columns (Eastern/Western hemispheres). Each row has a rating select (Largely Similar / Mixed / Largely Different), a justification textarea, a Save Row button (localStorage via `saveMatrixRow89()`), and a static `<a class="btn-capture">` anchor tag. Synthesis field at bottom with Save Synthesis + capture buttons. Draft persistence: `response-area` class auto-load + `loadMatrixDrafts89()` called via `setTimeout` after `renderMatrix89()` sets modal innerHTML. All matrix render functions defined as `window.*` globals in `lesson-8-9-renderer-config.js`.

**Unit Review module (module 03):** `renderUnitReview89()` returns an 8-card grid (Topics 8.1–8.8), each with topic label, title, 2–3 sentence summary, and a "Matrix evidence" hint line.

**AI coaching touchpoints:** First & 10 (3-question check section + AI Coach prompt builder) and Checkpoint 2 (full LO K LEQ). No BeInTheRoom touchpoint. MagicSchool URL: `https://student.magicschool.ai/s/login?joinCode=czwb9Q`.

**Step 0 gate:** N/A — capstone topics have no BeInTheRoom scenario.

**Verified character-level traps:**
- 8.3 "Sandinista–Contras": EN DASH (U+2013) present ✓
- 8.7 "military–industrial complex": EN DASH (U+2013) present ✓
- 8.7 KC-6.2.V "groups—including states—": EM DASH (U+2014) present ✓
- 8.5 "Québécois": both accents present ✓
- 8.5 "Kwame Nkrumah in British Gold Coast (Ghana)": no spurious "the" ✓
- 8.4 "Land reform in Kerala and other states within India": full phrase present ✓
- 8.8 KC-6.2.IV.E "Soviet Union's": apostrophe present ✓
- 8.9 thematic focus: ABSENT (correct — CED lists none for Topic 8.9) ✓
- 8.9 BeInTheRoom: ABSENT from modules array and no `lesson.beInTheRoom` set ✓

**Deferred (8.5 only):** The third KC in `lesson-8-5-renderer-config.js` is labeled `KC-6.2.I.C`, matching the project CED working copy. If the published CED reads `KC-6.2.II.C`, this is a discrepancy. Teacher should verify against the physical CED PDF. No change made per audit protocol.

**No fixes were applied.** All nine renderer configs are CED-compliant as written. Cache-busting bumps are not required (no config files were edited).

**Cache-bust follow-up (2026-06-27):** Zero renderer configs were modified by the audit, so zero lesson shells required a cache-bust. No shell edits were made. **Unit 8 audit cycle CLOSED.**

### Open Revision Tasks (from the audit)

- **DRIFT — `beintheroom/unit-1/khmer-court.html` (Topic 1.3):** Its central dilemma is a generic state-priorities allocation (temples / military / agriculture / trade) that is structurally identical to `song-court.html` and fails the transplant test; Topic 1.3's listed CDI-G / GOV-H pairing (belief systems shaping state power) drives only one of four options, and its reflection prompt is generic. Recommended: retire it as superseded by `angkor-council.html` (which the lesson actually links), or redesign its decision points and reflection around religion-as-state-power per LO G/H.
- **Discrepancies flagged in the report (not fixed):**
  - D1: Unit 1 renderer configs carry no thematic focus / LO blocks (unlike Unit 7 configs).
  - D2: `assets/data/lesson-1-6-europe.js` mislabels its Europe LO as "Unit 1 Learning Objective H" (H belongs to Topic 1.3).
  - D4: Three orphaned scenario files (`abbasid-fragmentation`, `khmer-court`, `cahokia-council`) are linked from no lesson; the BeInTheRoom hub page lists only `song-court`.
  - D5: 23 BeInTheRoom scenario files referenced by Unit 2–7 lesson data/configs do not exist yet (broken Module 09 links); each must clear Step 0 when built.
